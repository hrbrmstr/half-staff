Governor Ned Lamont has ordered the lowering of U.S. and Connecticut State flags to half-staff on Friday, July 29, 2002 in honor of Muddy Brook Fire Department Firefighter George W. Brown, who died in the line of duty following a response to an emergency call for service.
<br/>
“Chief Brown dedicated himself to public protection, including through his military service during the Vietnam War and as a lifelong member of the Muddy Brook Fire Department,” Governor Lamont said. “His line-of-duty passing following a response to an emergency call for service is heartbreaking, and I extended my condolences to his friends, family, and colleagues in the fire department.”
<br/>
Accordingly, since no flag should fly higher than the U.S. flag, all other flags, including state, municipal, corporate, or otherwise, should also be lowered during this same duration of time.
<br/>
<br/>
A memorial service in Brown’s honor is scheduled to be held Friday morning in East Woodstock.
<br/>
<br/>
Brown was a past fire chief of the department and a member for more than 50 years. He graduated from Woodstock Academy in 1967 and served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War.
<br/>
“Chief Brown was a devoted public servant and patriot, who served both his Woodstock community and his country during the Vietnam War,” Lt. Governor Susan Bysiewicz said. “His selfless career with the Muddy Brook Fire Department epitomizes his dedication to serving and protecting others, and his line-of-duty passing is a tragedy. I extend my sincerest condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues in the fire department and Woodstock community.”

Today, acting on behalf of Governor Mike Parson, Lieutenant Governor Mike Kehoe ordered the U.S. and Missouri flags to be flown at half-staff at government buildings in Clay and Jackson counties on Wednesday, July 27, 2022, to honor North Kansas City Police Department Officer Daniel F. Vasquez. They will be lowered from sunrise until sunset, and will be lowered again on the day Officer Vasquez will be laid to rest (unknown).
<br/>
<br/>
“Officer Vasquez pursued his dream of becoming a police officer with enthusiasm and determination,” Governor Mike Parson said. “It takes a special type of individual to devote his or her life to public service and accept the risks and sacrifices that come with protecting the public. Daniel Vasquez was willing to do that and more. It is tragic that senseless violence has taken the life of a young officer with such a bright future. Our prayers are with his family and the law enforcement community.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Officer Daniel Vasquez bravely and proudly served his community, fulfilling his lifelong dream of working in law enforcement,” Lieutenant Governor Mike Kehoe said. “Claudia and I continue to pray for Daniel’s family and the entire law enforcement community during this difficult time. This tragic act of violence is a solemn reminder of the dangers law enforcement officers face each day to keep their communities safe, and of the debt we owe these heroes for their courageous service.”
<br/>
On July 19, Officer Vasquez was on duty when he initiated a vehicle stop of a motorist for an expired temporary vehicle registration. He was ambushed and mortally wounded as he approached the stopped vehicle on foot. He was posthumously awarded the North Kansas City Police Department Medal of Valor.
<br/>
Officer Vasquez, 32, began his career with the North Kansas City Police Department when he entered the Kansas City Regional Police Academy on January 4, 2021. He graduated on July 8, 2021, and received his Missouri Peace Officer license and was commissioned by the department the same day. Prior to joining the police department, Vasquez had served as a civilian detention officer with the Kansas City Police Department and as a security officer for the Independence Avenue Community Improvement District.
<br/>
The flags will be held at half-staff on the day Officer Vasquez is laid to rest.

Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer has ordered U.S. and
Michigan flags within the State Capitol Complex and upon all public buildings
and grounds across the State of Michigan to be lowered to half-staff on Monday,
July 18, 2022, to honor and remember Detroit Police Officer Loren Courts who
was shot and killed in the line of duty.
<br/>
“Michigan will lower flags
Monday to mourn the loss Detroit Police Officer Loren Courts, a dedicated
public servant, father, and son,” said Governor Whitmer. “Our hearts go out to Officer Courts’ family, friends, and
fellow officers through this difficult time and the entire community that has
been impacted by this devastating act of violence. We will continue backing up
law enforcement not only with our words, but with our actions. Together we will
protect public safety, reduce gun violence, and save lives.”
<br/>
Officer Loren Courts was a
second-generation officer and served on the Detroit Police Department for a
tour of five years, serving and protecting the city of Detroit. He leaves
behind a wife of 11 years, two children, and close immediate family.
<br/>
Officer Loren Courts passed away on Wednesday,
July 6 at 40 years old.
<br/>
The State of Michigan recognizes
the duty, honor, and service of fallen Officer Loren Courts by lowering flags
to half-staff. Michigan residents, businesses, schools, local governments, and
other organizations also are encouraged to display the flag at half-staff.
<br/>
To lower flags to half-staff,
flags should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to
the half-staff position. The process is reversed before the flag is lowered for
the day.
<br/>
Flags should be returned to full
staff on Tuesday, July 19, 2022.

Gov. Tony Evers signed Executive Order #171
ordering the flags of the United States and the state of Wisconsin to be
flown at half-staff on Wed., July 13, 2022, in honor of Judge John P. Roemer,
who passed away on June 3, 2022, at the age of 68.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"There is no doubt that Judge Roemer was a pillar of his community, a revered
member of the judiciary, and a deeply admired and respected man by those who
had the fortune to know him," said Gov. Evers. "Judge Roemer's contributions to
his community and our state will not be forgotten as he leaves behind a legacy
of dedicated, distinguished service that has already inspired so many. Kathy
and I join the people of Wisconsin in praying for Judge Roemer's family,
friends, colleagues, neighbors, and the greater community as we mourn his
tragic passing."
<br/>
<br/>
Judge Roemer was a role model, both on and off the bench, said Wisconsin
Supreme Court Chief Justice Annette Kingsland Ziegler.
<br/>
<br/>
"As a judge, he was known for his sharp legal mind, thoughtful handling of
cases, and respect for all parties in the courtroom. He served as a mentor to
many judges and others in the legal profession, and many of his colleagues
became his friends. His dedication to others extended into his retirement as he
cared for family members, volunteered, and became a leader at his church. He
will truly be missed, but his impact is lasting," Chief Justice Ziegler said.
<br/>
<br/>
Judge Roemer was a committed public servant, having been an assistant state
public defender in Baraboo for five years and an assistant district attorney in
Juneau County for more than a decade. In 2002, Roemer retired from the U.S.
Army Reserves as a lieutenant colonel, and in 2004, he was elected to the
Juneau County Circuit Court, where he served until his retirement in 2017.
Roemer was also an active member of St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Mauston where he served as president of the church council, chairman of the
evangelism committee, and in the church's community outreach initiatives.
<br/>
Services for Judge Roemer will be held on
Wed., July 13, 2022, in Mauston.
<br/>
<br/>
Executive Order #171 will be in effect from sunrise to sunset on Wed., July 13,
2022.

Governor Ned Lamont today announced that he is directing U.S. and state flags in Connecticut lowered to half-staff in honor of Sandy Hook Fire Chief William Halstead, who died in the line of duty after responding to a call on Friday evening.
<br/>
Flags should be lowered immediately and remain lowered until sunset on the date of interment, which has not yet been determined. Accordingly, since no flag should fly higher than the U.S. flag, all other flags, including state, municipal, corporate, or otherwise, should also be lowered during this same duration of time.
<br/>
The Office of the Governor will send out a notification when flags should be returned to full-staff.
<br/>
"Chief Halstead provided decades of service to the community in which he grew up and the community he loved," Governor Lamont said. "His dedication is exemplary, and we are lucky to have leaders like him protecting the residents of Connecticut. His passing after responding to a call in the line of duty is heartbreaking, and I send my deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and fellow firefighters from the Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire and Rescue Company."
<br/>
"Chief Halstead exemplified what it meant to be a true public servant, providing decades of selfless service to his beloved community," Lt. Governor Susan Bysiewicz said. "Our state's firefighters are some of the most courageous citizens in Connecticut, and we will forever be indebted to their service. My most sincere condolences go out to Chief Halstead's family, friends, colleagues, and the Sandy Hook community."
<br/>
Chief Halstead joined the Sandy Hook Volunteer Fire and Rescue Company in January 1965 when he turned 16. He has served as its chief since 1978.

The longest serving Prime Minister in Japan's history, Abe Shinzo was a proud servant of the Japanese people and a faithful friend to the United States. He worked with American Presidents of both parties to deepen the Alliance between our nations and advance a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Even in the moment he was attacked and killed, he was engaged in the work of democracy, to which he dedicated his life.
<br/>
As a mark of respect for the memory of Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, July 10, 2022. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
<br/>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.

<![CDATA[
The longest serving Prime Minister in Japan's history, Abe Shinzo was a proud servant of the Japanese people and a faithful friend to the United States. He worked with American Presidents of both parties to deepen the Alliance between our nations and advance a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Even in the moment he was attacked and killed, he was engaged in the work of democracy, to which he dedicated his life.
<br/>
As a mark of respect for the memory of Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, July 10, 2022. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
<br/>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-seventh.
<br/>
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

"Detective Terry served our community for more than two decades — we are endlessly grateful for his service and heartbroken at his death," said Governor Sisolak. "Kathy and I join the law enforcement community and so many more in mourning Detective Justin Terry, who was killed tragically. We're sending our love and prayers to his family and friends during this difficult time."
<br/>
Detective Terry was a member of the LVMPD for just shy of 21 years. He started a program in the Southeast Area Command, making it possible for officers to ride dirt bikes into difficult locations to serve the homeless, according to Metro. He was also assigned to the Sexual Offender Apprehension Detail (SOAP) for 7 years. He was widely regarded as an expert and worked directly with the U.S. Marshals Task Force.

On Thursday, Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez and Vice President Myron Lizer issued a proclamation ordering all flags on the Navajo Nation to be flown at half-staff to honor the memory and service of the late Edward T. Begay, former Vice Chairman of the Navajo Nation and Speaker of the Navajo Nation Council, from Friday, June 17 through Monday, June 20, 2022. Begay passed away in Albuquerque, N.M. on Sunday at the age of 87.
<br/>
The funeral service for Begay is scheduled to be held on Monday, June 20, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. MDT at the Rehoboth Christian Reformed Church in Rehoboth, N.M. The burial will be at the Rehoboth Cemetery after the funeral service, followed by a reception at Red Rock State Park Convention Center in Church Rock, N.M.
<br/>
"We honor and remember our leader as a very loving and compassionate person who gave of himself to help many of our Navajo people and his work lives on through much of the progress and improvements that we see in our communities to this day. The proclamation issued today is a tribute to his life of service and the legacy that he built for his family and all of our people. We will continue to honor him as the fearless leader and devoted family man that he was. He set a great example for all Navajo leaders to follow. His family, former colleagues, and friends remain in our thoughts and prayers during this time," said President Nez.
<br/>
Begay is TÃ³dÃ­ch'Ã­i'nii and born for the Tl'ogi clan, his maternal grandfather was TÃ¡chii'nii and his paternal grandfather was Kinyaa'Ã¡anii. He grew up in the Nose Rock area of what is now called "Superman Canyon" in New Mexico. Begay married his high school sweetheart, Cecilia M. Damon, in 1961. Together, they had two daughters, Sharlene Begay-Platero and Sandra Begay, and a sonin-law, John Platero, Jr. Begay's beloved wife, Cecilia, died in 1991.
<br/>
From 1971 to 1983, Begay represented the Church Rock and Breadsprings Chapters on the Navajo Tribal Council. During his career as Council Delegate, Begay chaired the Advisory Committee, the Education Committee, the Economic Development and Planning Committee, the Budget and Finance Committee, and the Federal Restructuring Task Force. In 1982, Peterson Zah and Begay successfully campaigned for the offices of Navajo Nation Chairman and Vice-Chairman, serving Navajo Nation from 1983 to 1987. As Vice-Chairman, Begay gained a national perspective on issues affecting Native Americans, particularly the Navajo people.
<br/>
"Ed T. was a loving husband, caring father, and gracious grandfather, but to many, he was Cheii. We will miss him at our dinner table, sitting next to us in church, and listening to his stories of the journeys his life has taken him on. We are extremely proud of his service to the Navajo Nation, the State of New Mexico, and his tribal home communities," his family stated.
<br/>
"Our words are not enough to express the appreciation we have for the life of the Honorable Edward T. Begay. He laid his hands to such great work during his lifetime and many of our people continue to benefit from his service and contributions to our Nation. We will always cherish him in our hearts and minds as we continue to offer prayers for comfort and strength for his family and community," said Vice President Lizer.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer has
ordered U.S. and Michigan flags within the State Capitol Complex and upon all
public buildings and grounds across the state of Michigan to be lowered to
half-staff on Sunday, June 12, 2022, in honor of former U.S. Senator and
lifelong Michigander, Carl Levin, who passed away last year at age 87. The
flags will be lowered in concert with the planned memorial service on Sunday
for former U.S. Senator Levin.
<br/>
"Senator
Carl Levin was a champion for Michigan. His 36-year tenure in the United States
Senate, the longest in state history, was marked by a tireless commitment to
our auto industry, Great Lakes, and men and women in uniform," said Governor
Whitmer. "Carl would often wear
his glasses on the tip of his nose, but he saw the best in us. He saw what we
were capable of when we came to the table as Michiganders, as Americans, to get
things done. Carl devoted his life to public service, and it is up to us to
follow his example."
<br/>
Senator
Carl Levin represented the state of Michigan in the U.S. Senate for 36 years,
marking him as the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Michigan history. Senator
Levin's time in Congress was defined by his commitment to our auto industry,
Great Lakes, and men and women in uniform. He also secured funds to create the
Detroit Riverwalk and wrote the bill that established Sleeping Bear Dunes
National Park.
<br/>
Senator
Levin passed away on July 29, 2021, at age 87.
<br/>
The
State of Michigan recognizes the duty, honor, and selfless service of former
U.S. Senator Carl Levin by lowering flags to half-staff. Michigan residents,
businesses, schools, local governments, and other organizations also are
encouraged to display the flag at half-staff.
<br/>
To
lower flags to half-staff, flags should be hoisted first to the peak for an
instant and the lowered to the half-staff position. The process is reversed

<br/>
Flags
should be returned to full staff on Monday, June 13, 2022.

<br/>
"We celebrate and honor the life of Richard Johnson and the
dedicated service he provided our great state for over two decades," Gov. Reynolds said. "Mr. Johnson was a true family
man and had a love for serving as the State Auditor. He was a trusted official
who was steadfast in his duty of protecting and upholding the integrity of
state taxpayer dollars. He did everything in his power to assure Iowans their
tax dollars would not be misspent, and he made our state a better place through
his work."
<br/>
Flags will be at half-staff on the State Capitol Building
and on flag displays on the Capitol Complex. Flags will also be at half-staff

On Memorial Day the American flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff. All subordinate flags will fly below the level of the American flag.
<br/>
A Proclamation: Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day 2022
<br/>
On Memorial Day, we remember the patriots who gave their lives in the service of America, in the service of freedom, and in the service of justice. They made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our Constitution and our democracy. We are free because they were brave, and we live by the light of the flame of liberty they kept burning. They are all heroes, and our Nation is forever grateful.
<br/>
Those who wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces know the pride of service and what it means to dedicate themselves to a cause greater than themselves. These women and men put their lives on the line for an idea — the idea of America. They are the best of us. On this day, as we honor the fallen angels who consecrated this great Nation and the ideals that we stand for with their blood, we rededicate ourselves to the unending work of bringing our country ever closer to that more perfect Union for which they died.
<br/>
Today and every day, we ask God to protect our troops, to shine light perpetual upon the fallen, and to bring comfort to their families. To those who mourn a loved one, and to America's Gold Star Families who have lost a loved one in conflict, my heart aches for you. Our Nation owes you and those you have lost a tremendous debt that we can never fully repay. On Memorial Day, we vow to honor their memories and support the families, caregivers, and survivors they left behind.
<br/>
As we honor the memories of our fallen heroes, we are grateful for the future they made possible for us and rededicate ourselves to seeking enduring peace. Our heroes gave their lives for our country, and they live forever in our hearts — forever proud, forever honorable, and forever American.
<br/>
In honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer and reflection. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.
<br/>
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 30, 2022, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer and reflection. I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance. I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.
<br/>
I request the Governors of the United States and its Commonwealths and Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.
<br/>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.
<br/>
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

Governor
Kate Brown today ordered all flags at Oregon public institutions to be flown at
half-staff from now until sunset tonight in honor and remembrance of Gerry
Frank, who died March 13, 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"It is hard to overstate Gerry Frank's contributions, through decades of
service, to our community in Salem and to the state of Oregon," said
Governor Brown. "As the Chief of Staff to Senator Mark Hatfield for over
20 years, he was sometimes called Oregon's Third Senator. He also advised
countless governors throughout the years, myself included. I am lucky to have
called Gerry a trusted counselor and friend.
<br/>
<br/>
"No matter how far Gerry traveled, Salem was always home. He could have lived
and worked anywhere——he visited over 150 countries, meeting world leaders and
dignitaries around the globe——but after his service in Washington, DC, he
returned to Salem. His vision was for Salem to be among the finest capital
cities in the world. He was a fixture in our community in so many ways——for 60
consecutive years, he sat on the stage at the Oregon State Fair to judge the
chocolate cake contest, always filling the room with laughter. Gerry packed a
lot of life into his time here with us.
<br/>
<br/>
"Dan and I send our hearts to Gerry's family and his many, many friends today.
It was a pleasure to honor Gerry last summer, with the dedication of the Gerry
Frank Rotary Amphitheater at Riverfront Park. I am glad that, for decades to
come, Oregonians and others will be able to visit the amphitheater and learn
about a person who contributed so much to this great state we call home."
<br/>
<br/>
The date of the flag order, May 19, coincides with Gerry Frank's memorial
service, which took place today.

"It is hard to overstate Gerry Frank's contributions, through decades of
service, to our community in Salem and to the state of Oregon," said
Governor Brown. "As the Chief of Staff to Senator Mark Hatfield for over
20 years, he was sometimes called Oregon's Third Senator. He also advised
countless governors throughout the years, myself included. I am lucky to have
called Gerry a trusted counselor and friend.
<br/>
<br/>
"No matter how far Gerry traveled, Salem was always home. He could have lived
and worked anywhere——he visited over 150 countries, meeting world leaders and
dignitaries around the globe——but after his service in Washington, DC, he
returned to Salem. His vision was for Salem to be among the finest capital
cities in the world. He was a fixture in our community in so many ways——for 60
consecutive years, he sat on the stage at the Oregon State Fair to judge the
chocolate cake contest, always filling the room with laughter. Gerry packed a
lot of life into his time here with us.
<br/>
<br/>
"Dan and I send our hearts to Gerry's family and his many, many friends today.
It was a pleasure to honor Gerry last summer, with the dedication of the Gerry
Frank Rotary Amphitheater at Riverfront Park. I am glad that, for decades to
come, Oregonians and others will be able to visit the amphitheater and learn
about a person who contributed so much to this great state we call home."
<br/>
<br/>
The date of the flag order, May 19, coincides with Gerry Frank's memorial
service, which took place today.

A Proclamation on Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2022
<br/>
For generations, courageous men and women of our Nation's law enforcement community have dedicated their lives to protecting us in big cities, small towns, and suburban neighborhoods across America. Each morning, police officers pin on their shield and walk out the door to go to work, hoping they will come home safely. Last year, a record number of law enforcement officers died in the line of duty. On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we express our gratitude for these selfless public servants who put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe and honor those who lost their lives in the line of duty.
<br/>
As we see a rise in gun violence and other violent crimes, it is critical that we fund law enforcement with the resources and training they need to do their jobs safely and effectively. That is why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, States, counties, and tribes can use to hire more police officers and invest in proven strategies like community violence intervention, youth programming, and other supportive services. It is also why my proposed 2023 budget more than doubles funding for effective community policing through the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Program. In addition, my budget increases support for the United States Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, so they can apprehend fugitives and fight illegal gun trafficking.
<br/>
Gun violence not only affects community members, it also targets law enforcement officers. Last month at the White House, surrounded by law enforcment, community leaders, and families who have lost loved ones to gun violence, we announced that the Department of Justice is reining in the proliferation of "ghost guns" — privately-made firearms without serial numbers that are increasingly showing up on our streets and being used to attack law enforcement officers and members of the public.
<br/>
My Administration is also committed to supporting programs that protect the physical safety of our law enforcement — more bulletproof vests, active shooter trainings, and early warnings of threats targeting officers. We must also do more to protect our officers' mental health and emotional well-being. Suicide and COVID-19 were among the leading causes of death for law enforcement officers in 2021. Last November, I was proud to sign into law three bills that extend critical peer counseling and mental health resources for officers, expand eligibility and benefits for first responders disabled in the line of duty, and protect Federal law enforcement serving abroad. Our officers swear an oath to protect us, and we owe them the same pledge.
<br/>
We must not abandon our streets or accept the false choice between public safety and equal justice. The solution is not to defund our police. It is to make our streets more secure through policing that treats everyone with dignity and respect. It is to provide officers with the resources, tools, and training they need to keep our neighborhoods safe.
<br/>
During Police Week, let us demonstrate our appreciation for the unsung heroes who nobly wear the badge and put their lives at risk to protect people each and every day. Let us honor the brave officers whose bright futures were cut short in the line of duty. Let us come together to help police be the partners and protectors our communities and our Nation need for a safer, more just America.
<br/>
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as "Peace Officers Memorial Day" and the week in which it falls as "Police Week."
<br/>
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2022, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 15 through May 21, 2022, as Police Week. I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities and salute our Nation's brave law enforcement officers and remember their peace officer brothers and sisters who have given their last full measure of devotion in the line of duty. I also call on the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.
<br/>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this
thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.
<br/>
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

Gov. Tony Evers signed Executive Order #162 ordering the flags of the United States and the state of Wisconsin to be flown at half-staff on Sat., May 14, 2022, in honor of Hmong-Lao Veterans Day.
<br/>
<br/>
On May 14, 2021, Gov. Evers signed 2021 Wisconsin Act 31, designating May 14 as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day in Wisconsin and requiring the governor to annually issue a proclamation for the observance of Hmong-Lao Veterans Day that orders the flags at the State Capitol Building to be flown at half-staff, requests that the day be used to recall veterans' accomplishments and to thank veterans for their service, and encourages schools to discuss Hmong military service in support of the armed forces of the United States.
<br/>
"Last year, I was proud to sign 2021 Wisconsin Act 31 into law to not only recognize and honor Wisconsin's Hmong-Lao veterans but to ensure future generations of Wisconsinites continue to learn about and understand the critical role Hmong-Lao people played in the Vietnam War," said Gov. Evers. "On Hmong-Lao Veterans Day, we join all Wisconsinites in honoring the sacrifices and service of the thousands of Hmong-Lao veterans who fought alongside the United States and recognize the many Hmong-Lao veterans who call Wisconsin home today."
<br/>
<br/>
During the Vietnam War, thousands of Hmong-Lao people courageously fought alongside the United States, and following the end of the war, faced harsh retribution from the Vietnamese and Lao governments for their service. Many Hmong-Lao soldiers and their families were ultimately forced to flee their homes and many later resettled in communities throughout the United States, including in Wisconsin. May 14, 1975, is recognized as the last day of airlift evacuation of remaining Hmong-Lao soldiers and their families from the covert headquarters in Long Tieng, Laos to the Nam Phong refugee camp in Thailand.
<br/>
In addition to signing Executive Order #162, Gov. Evers has proclaimed May 14, as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day in Wisconsin each year since assuming office in 2019

<br/>
Army Cpl. Donald L. Menken,
21, of Whitesburg, Kentucky, died during combat in June 1953. Cpl. Menken will be interred Saturday at Green Acres Cemetery in Ermine,
Kentucky.
<br/>
All individuals,
businesses, organizations and government agencies are encouraged to join in
this tribute. Although flags statewide are already at half-staff in remembrance
of the 1,000,000 American lives lost to COVID-19, Saturday's flag lowering will
also serve to honor the sacrifice of Cpl. Menken.

Gov. Tony Evers signed Executive Order #162 ordering the flags of the United States and the state of Wisconsin to be flown at half-staff on Sat., May 14, 2022, in honor of Hmong-Lao Veterans Day.
<br/>
<br/>
On May 14, 2021, Gov. Evers signed 2021 Wisconsin Act 31, designating May 14 as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day in Wisconsin and requiring the governor to annually issue a proclamation for the observance of Hmong-Lao Veterans Day that orders the flags at the State Capitol Building to be flown at half-staff, requests that the day be used to recall veterans' accomplishments and to thank veterans for their service, and encourages schools to discuss Hmong military service in support of the armed forces of the United States.
<br/>
"Last year, I was proud to sign 2021 Wisconsin Act 31 into law to not only recognize and honor Wisconsin's Hmong-Lao veterans but to ensure future generations of Wisconsinites continue to learn about and understand the critical role Hmong-Lao people played in the Vietnam War," said Gov. Evers. "On Hmong-Lao Veterans Day, we join all Wisconsinites in honoring the sacrifices and service of the thousands of Hmong-Lao veterans who fought alongside the United States and recognize the many Hmong-Lao veterans who call Wisconsin home today."
<br/>
<br/>
During the Vietnam War, thousands of Hmong-Lao people courageously fought alongside the United States, and following the end of the war, faced harsh retribution from the Vietnamese and Lao governments for their service. Many Hmong-Lao soldiers and their families were ultimately forced to flee their homes and many later resettled in communities throughout the United States, including in Wisconsin. May 14, 1975, is recognized as the last day of airlift evacuation of remaining Hmong-Lao soldiers and their families from the covert headquarters in Long Tieng, Laos to the Nam Phong refugee camp in Thailand.
<br/>
In addition to signing Executive Order #162, Gov. Evers has proclaimed May 14, as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day in Wisconsin each year since assuming office in 2019

A Proclamation on Remembering the 1,000,000 Americans Lost to COVID-—19
<br/>
Today, we mark a tragic milestone: one million American lives lost to COVID-19. One million empty chairs around the dinner table. Each an irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a Nation forever changed because of this pandemic. Jill and I pray for each of them.
<br/>
As a Nation, we must not grow numb to such sorrow. To heal, we must remember. We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible. In remembrance, let us draw strength from each other as fellow Americans. For while we have been humbled, we never give up. We can and will do this together as the United States of America.
<br/>
In memory of the one million American lives lost to COVID-19 and their loved ones left behind, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset May 16, 2022. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
<br/>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.

Governor Kim Reynolds ordered all flags in Iowa to be lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Friday, May 6 for the Iowa Peace Officer Memorial Ceremony.
<br/>
<br/>
This year, two fallen officers will be honored during the ceremony. The Iowa State Patrol's Sergeant Jim K. Smith and Trooper Ted Benda dedicated their lives to serving Iowans to protect and keep our communities safe.
<br/>
<br/>
In April 2021, Sergeant Jim K. Smith became only the second trooper to be shot and killed in the line of duty while attempting to arrest a subject who had assaulted and disarmed another law enforcement officer during a traffic stop near Grundy Center.
<br/>
<br/>
In October 2021, Trooper Ted Benda passed away from injuries sustained in an auto accident, while in route to assist a local law enforcement agency with the apprehension of a wanted subject in Clayton County.
<br/>
<br/>
"These two officers gave their lives in one of the noblest causes there is — one defined by an unrelenting determination to put others above self. Iowa will remember their service and sacrifice with enduring gratitude," Governor Reynolds said. "While our state continues to grieve the loss of such wonderful men — devoted husbands, fathers, and members of their communities — we also take intense pride in the selfless heroism they both displayed in roles."
<br/>
<br/>
Flags will be at half-staff on the State Capitol Building and on flag displays in the Capitol Complex. Flags will also be at half-staff on all public buildings, grounds and facilities throughout the state.
<br/>
<br/>
Individuals, businesses, schools, municipalities, counties and other government subdivisions are encouraged to fly the flag at half-staff for the same length of time as a sign of respect.

Governor Kim Reynolds ordered all flags in Iowa to be lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Friday, May 6 for the Iowa Peace Officer Memorial Ceremony.
<br/>
<br/>
This year, two fallen officers will be honored during the ceremony. The Iowa State Patrol's Sergeant Jim K. Smith and Trooper Ted Benda dedicated their lives to serving Iowans to protect and keep our communities safe.
<br/>
<br/>
In April 2021, Sergeant Jim K. Smith became only the second trooper to be shot and killed in the line of duty while attempting to arrest a subject who had assaulted and disarmed another law enforcement officer during a traffic stop near Grundy Center.
<br/>
<br/>
In October 2021, Trooper Ted Benda passed away from injuries sustained in an auto accident, while in route to assist a local law enforcement agency with the apprehension of a wanted subject in Clayton County.
<br/>
<br/>
"These two officers gave their lives in one of the noblest causes there is — one defined by an unrelenting determination to put others above self. Iowa will remember their service and sacrifice with enduring gratitude," Governor Reynolds said. "While our state continues to grieve the loss of such wonderful men — devoted husbands, fathers, and members of their communities — we also take intense pride in the selfless heroism they both displayed in roles."
<br/>
<br/>
Flags will be at half-staff on the State Capitol Building and on flag displays in the Capitol Complex. Flags will also be at half-staff on all public buildings, grounds and facilities throughout the state.
<br/>
<br/>
Individuals, businesses, schools, municipalities, counties and other government subdivisions are encouraged to fly the flag at half-staff for the same length of time as a sign of respect.

A Proclamation on the Death of Madeleine Korbel Albright
<br/>
Madeleine Albright was a force. She defied convention and broke barriers again and again. She was an immigrant fleeing persecution. A refugee in need of safe haven. And like so many before her — and after — she was proudly American.
<br/>
As the devoted mother of three beloved daughters, she worked tirelessly raising them while earning her doctorate degree and starting her career in American diplomacy. She took her talents first to the Senate as a staffer for Senator Edmund Muskie followed by the National Security Council under President Carter. And then to the United Nations where she served as United States Ambassador, and ultimately, made history as our first woman Secretary of State, appointed by President Clinton. A scholar, teacher, bestselling author, and later accomplished business woman, she always believed America was the indispensable Nation, and inspired the next generation of public servants to follow her lead, including countless women leaders around the world. Madeleine was always a force for goodness, grace, and decency — and for freedom.
<br/>
As a mark of respect for former Secretary of State Madeleine Korbel Albright and her life of service to our Nation, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on March 27, 2022. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
<br/>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.
<br/>
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) Commissioner Robert Evanchick confirmed today that Trooper Martin F. Mack III, 33, and Trooper Branden T. Sisca, 29, were struck and killed by a driver earlier this morning on I-95 south in the area of milepost 18 in Philadelphia City, Philadelphia County. A male pedestrian was also struck and killed at the same time.
<br/>
The troopers were dispatched after receiving reports of a man walking on I-95 south. As they were helping him into the back of their cruiser, the female suspect attempted to drive past the scene. She fatally struck all three and the cruiser just before 1:00 a.m. and remained at the scene.
<br/>
"Our department is heartbroken with the tragedy that occurred early this morning in Philadelphia," said Colonel Evanchick. "We ask our fellow Pennsylvanians to keep the families of our troopers and the pedestrian in their thoughts. This is an extremely difficult time."
<br/>
Mack enlisted in the Pennsylvania State Police in November 2014 and graduated as a member of the 141st cadet class. Sisca enlisted in the Pennsylvania State Police in February 2021 and graduated as a member of the 161st cadet class. Both troopers spent their entire careers assigned to the Patrol Section of Troop K, Philadelphia.
<br/>
Governor Tom Wolf ordered the commonwealth flag on all commonwealth facilities, public buildings, and grounds to fly at half-staff to honor Trooper Mack and Trooper Sisca. The commonwealth flag shall be lowered to half-staff until sunset on Friday, March 25, 2022, as well as on the day(s) of their funerals which have not yet been announced. The United States flag is to remain at full-staff through this tribute.
<br/>
All Pennsylvanians are invited to participate.
<br/>
"This is a heartbreaking tragedy that occurred while these troopers were protecting and serving," said Gov. Wolf. "This mournful incident is a stark reminder of the risks—and sacrifices—our law enforcement officers undertake every day to keep us safe. My heart goes out to their families and the communities they lived in and served."

President Biden ordered the United States Flag to be flown at half-staff effective immediately and returned to full staff at midnight tonight, Saturday, March 19, 2022 in honor of the passing of Representative Don Young. Young was the longest-serving member of Congress, representing Alaska as a Republican in the United States House of Representatives from 1973 until his death on Friday, March 18.
<br/>
Statement by President Joe Biden on the Passing of Congressman Don Young
<br/>
I knew Don Young for a long time. He always stayed true to who he was and the people of Alaska he represented. Tough. Loyal. A consensus builder.
<br/>
He was larger than life, but always focused on Alaskans' everyday lives. As Dean of the House, he was the longest-serving House Republican in history—but cherished photos of his legislation being signed into law by ten presidents, Republicans and Democrats.
<br/>
There is no doubt that few legislators have left a greater mark on their state. Don's legacy lives on in the infrastructure projects he delighted in steering across Alaska. In the opportunities he advanced for his constituents. In the enhanced protections for Native tribes he championed. His legacy will continue in the America he loved.
<br/>
Jill and I send our prayers to his wife Anne, to his daughters and the entire Young family, and to the people of Alaska.
<br/>
May God bless Don Young.

Today, acting on behalf of Governor Mike Parson, Lt. Governor Mike Kehoe ordered U.S. and Missouri flags be flown at half-staff at all government buildings in Jasper and Newton counties on Friday, March 18, 2022, from sunrise to sunset in honor of Joplin Police Officer Jake Reed.
<br/>
On March 8, Officer Reed was shot and gravely wounded after responding to a disturbance call at a shopping center. He succumbed to his injuries on March 11 and donated his vital organs to several recipients.
<br/>
"Less than five years ago, at just 22 years of age, Jake Reed took an oath to protect his community, fight violence and run toward danger, no matter the risk to himself," Lt. Governor Kehoe said. "Last week, his courage and commitment to safeguarding others cost Officer Reed his life. His heroic service and contributions to Joplin are magnified by the gift of life he provided to others through organ donation. We must continue to support Officer Reed's family and the heroes of law enforcement who sacrifice each day to make our communities safer."
<br/>
"Missouri's law enforcement officers courageously respond to thousands of calls for assistance each day, regardless of the threats and challenges they may face," Governor Parson said. "That's what Joplin Police Officer Jake Reed did last week, and a violent criminal murdered the 27-year-old officer. We will always remember Officer Reed as a hero committed to protecting others. As we memorialize Officer Reed, Teresa and I continue to pray for his friends and family and the entire Joplin community. We will always be grateful for our Missouri law enforcement officers who answer the call each day."
<br/>
Officer Reed graduated from Missouri Southern State University Law Enforcement Academy in May 2017 and joined the Joplin Police Department that same month.
<br/>
The flags will be held at half-staff on the day Officer Reed is laid to rest.

Governor Ned Lamont today announced that he is directing U.S. and state flags in Connecticut lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Friday, March 18, 2022, in honor of Rocky Hill Fire Captain James Lamarre, who died in the line of duty as a result of work-related cancer. Funeral services are scheduled to be held on Friday at 10:00 a.m. at St. James Church in Rocky Hill.
<br/>
Captain Lamarre honorably served the Rocky Hill Fire Department for 27 years. A veteran of the U.S. Army, he was very active in the Benino-Beck VFW Post 2138 in Rocky Hill, serving as chaplain.
<br/>
"Captain Lamarre's passing is a terrible reminder of the dangers firefighters face throughout their careers in the name of public service and the protection of others," Governor Lamont said. "First responders like Captain Lamarre embody the best of our state and our country. On behalf of the State of Connecticut, I send my condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues in the Rocky Hill Fire Department and Benino-Beck VFW Post 2138. I ask the residents of our state to keep him and his family in your prayers."
<br/>
"Captain Lamarre exemplifies what it means to be a true public servant, dedicating his life to keeping others safe," Lt. Governor Susan Bysiewicz said. "His service will not be forgotten, and his legacy will live on through the lives of those he touched and the lives of those he saved. My most sincere condolences go to Captain Lamarre's family, friends, the Rocky Hill Fire Department, and Benino-Beck VFW Post 2138."
<br/>
"Connecticut's fire service extends heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the Lamarre's family, as well as to his extended fire service family in Rocky Hill and throughout the region," Connecticut State Fire Administrator Jeffrey Morrissette said. "Sadly, occupational cancer continues to be a leading cause of death among firefighters nationwide."

Today, acting on behalf of Governor Mike Parson, Lt. Governor Mike Kehoe ordered U.S. and Missouri flags be flown at half-staff at all government buildings in Jasper and Newton counties on Tuesday, March 15, 2022, from sunrise to sunset in honor of Joplin Police Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper.
<br/>
On March 8, Corporal Cooper was shot and killed after responding to a disturbance call at a shopping center.
<br/>
"Benjamin Cooper devoted his life to bravely serving and protecting others, first as a soldier, and then as a law enforcement officer," Lt. Governor Kehoe said. "In over 18 years in law enforcement, he honorably served as a patrolman, investigator, firearms instructor, SWAT officer, field training officer, canine officer, and internal affairs officer. Corporal Cooper's senseless killing is a reminder of the dangers law enforcement officers willingly face each day to keep us safe, and of the debt we owe them for their courageous service."
<br/>
"Corporal Cooper served and protected his fellow citizens with honor and dignity," Governor Parson said. "Due to this heinous violence against law enforcement officers, Corporal Cooper's wife is now without a husband and daughters without a father. This must end, and shows why we must always support our Missouri law enforcement officers — who only wish to serve. Our hearts go out to Corporal Cooper's family and friends as they mourn his tragic loss. Teresa and I will be praying for them."
<br/>
Corporal Cooper served in the U.S. Army from 1995 to 2001. He served in the Joplin Police Department from 2004 to 2008, when he left to serve as a deputy sheriff in Colorado. He returned to the Joplin Police Department in 2013 and was promoted to corporal in 2016.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer has ordered U.S. and Michigan flags within the State Capitol Complex to be lowered to half-staff on Wednesday, February 23, 2022 in honor of former state Representative Woodrow Stanley, who passed away at the age of 71 years old. The flag-lowering will coincide with the date of his funeral.

"Woodrow was a lifelong public servant who served his fellow Flintstones for decades on City Council, as Mayor, as County Commissioner, and in the Michigan Legislature, where we served together," said Governor Whitmer. "My thoughts are with his family and friends, and those of us who were lucky to call him a friend."
<br/>
Woodrow Stanley served a lengthy career in public service. In 1983, he was appointed to Flint City Council. Afterward, he served as president of the Michigan Municipal League. In 1991, he was elected as the mayor of Flint. In 2004, he began serving on the Genesee County Board of Commissioner's. In 2009, Stanley began his six years of service in the Michigan House of Representatives.
<br/>

The State of Michigan recognizes the duty, honor, and selfless service of former state Representative Woodrow Stanley by lowering flags to half-staff. Michigan residents, businesses, schools, local governments, and other organizations also are encouraged to display the flag at half-staff.
<br/>
To lower flags to half-staff, flags should be hoisted first to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The process is reversed before the flag is lowered for the day.
<br/>
Flags should be returned to full staff on Thursday, February 24, 2022.

Gov. Jim Justice has issued a proclamation, ordering that all United States and West Virginia flags at the Capitol Complex in Charleston and all state-owned facilities in Hancock County be displayed at half-staff from dawn to dusk tomorrow — Tuesday, Feb. 22, 2022 — in commemoration of the distinguished life and service of former West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Edwin Flowers.
<br/>
Flowers was appointed to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in 1975 and became United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of West Virginia in 1977.
<br/>
Flowers also served as State Commissioner of Welfare, beginning in 1969.
<br/>
Born in 1930 in New Manchester, WV, Flowers earned his bachelor's degree and law degree from West Virginia University.
<br/>
During his time as a student at WVU, Flowers served as president of the student body, president of his fraternity chapter, cadet colonel of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training, a member of the WVU Marching Band, and was a member of the WVU championship debate team.
<br/>
After law school, Flowers was assigned to active duty in the Judge Advocate General's Corps at Nellis Air Force Base.
<br/>
In 1983, Flowers returned to WVU to work as vice president for institutional advancement. He was awarded Most Loyal Faculty and Staff Mountaineer in 1999 and was inducted into the Order of Vandalia — an award for the most loyal servants to West Virginia University — in 2000.

Governor Doug Ducey ordered flags at all state buildings be lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset tomorrow, February 20, 2022, in honor of former Senator David Bradley, a long-time public servant who passed away today.
<br/>
"Arizona is saddened by the passing of Senator David Bradley," Governor Ducey said. "My deepest condolences go out to his wife Debbie, and his family and loved ones. Senator Bradley had an unwavering dedication to serving the people of Arizona, and we honor his life and years of public service. He was a true statesman who made a positive impact on the lives of many Arizonans across our state."
<br/>
Senator Bradley gave 25 years to public service, serving in the Navy, as a social worker for the state, and in the Arizona Legislature, where he served for 16 years. While in the Senate, he served as Minority Leader for two years, during which he worked across the aisle to advance important priorities. He was a licensed professional counselor and played an integral role in youth development.
<br/>
"David worked tirelessly to make Arizona a better place, whether through elected office, as a counselor for youth or his work for nonprofits. He cared deeply about doing what is best for Arizonans, and I have the utmost respect for him."
<br/>
"During his time in the Senate, he lived as an example that working across the aisle, for a common good, benefits all Arizonans. Whether by expanding educational opportunities for foster kids, addressing the opioid epidemic, or passing the Drought Contingency Plan, he made a lasting impact on our state."
<br/>
Individuals, businesses, and other organizations are encouraged to join in this tribute.

Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy and First Lady Rose Dunleavy mourn the loss of former Alaska State Senator Johnny Ellis who represented Anchorage. The former legislator passed away on February 9, 2022.
<br/>
"My family offers our sincerest condolences to the family and loved ones of former Senator Ellis," said Governor Dunleavy. "Johnny was an influential leader in the Alaska Democratic Party and was well respected across the board. As an educator, I respected Johnny as a colleague and as someone who mentored the next generation of Alaskans. He will be remembered as a traveler, learner, history buff and, of course, an accomplished politician."
<br/>
Johnny was born March 13, 1960, in Springfield, MO, and moved to Anchorage in 1975. He pursued higher education at the University of Alaska Anchorage and Claremont McKenna College. He was first elected to the state House at the young age of 26 and gave his life to politics, continuously serving Alaskans for about 24 years. Johnny served as a member of the Alaska House of Representatives from 1987 to 1993, then was elected to the Alaska Senate from 1993 to 2017 and was the majority leader of the Senate for several years. He dedicated any free moments to serving on upwards of 10 committees and boards. Outside of serving Alaska through politics, he was a business owner and was a commissioner of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.
<br/>
Governor Dunleavy has ordered that Alaska and U.S. flags fly at half-staff sunrise to sunset on February 15, 2022, in honor of former Senator Johnny Ellis. February 15th falls on the Key Coalition of Alaska's Key Campaign week, in which Johnny Ellis was the legislation champion of the effort.

Gov. Jim Justice has issued a proclamation, ordering that all United States and West Virginia flags at the Capitol Complex in Charleston and all state-owned facilities in Kanawha County be displayed at half-staff from dawn to dusk tomorrow — Thursday, Feb. 10, 2022 — in commemoration of the distinguished life and service of former West Virginia Delegate and Kanawha County Commissioner Henry "Hoppy" Shores.
<br/>
Shores, who passed away last week at the age of 92, served in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1986 to 1990.
<br/>
He was the longest-serving commissioner in Kanawha County history. First elected in 1966, he served on the commission for a total of 42 years.
<br/>
"Cathy and I will surely be offering our prayers for Hoppy and his family, and we ask all West Virginians to join us," Gov. Justice said on Monday. "This was a man who served his state for a long, long time. It's just amazing all he did to try to help people."
<br/>
Shores was also a United States Army veteran, earning the rank of major and serving stateside in Oklahoma and Texas.
<br/>
Shores graduated from Stonewall Jackson High School, where he led the Generals to the 1947 State Championship as a star running back. He went on to earn a business degree from West Virginia University.

He announced on Dec. 17, 2021, that he would not seek another term in office as attorney general.

"Like so many North Dakotans who treasured his friendship and admired him for his more than four decades of exceptional service to our state, we are absolutely devastated by the passing of Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem," Burgum said. "Wayne embodied public service, both as a dedicated legislator and the longest-serving attorney general in our state's 133-year history. As the top law enforcement officer in North Dakota for over two decades, Attorney General Stenehjem always put the safety and well-being of our citizens first. North Dakota is a safer place because of his unwavering commitment to law and order, his loyalty to his team members and his utmost respect for our men and women in uniform. State and local governments also are more transparent thanks to his strong enforcement of North Dakota's sunshine laws.
<br/>
"On a personal level, Wayne was extremely proud of his small-town roots, his ties to UND and time spent practicing law in Grand Forks, and especially his Scandinavian heritage. His dry Norwegian humor was at its sidesplitting best at Norsk HÃ¸sfest in Minot during the induction ceremonies for the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame — an honor he himself received in 2007. Most of all, he was a loving husband and father, often sharing photos of his travels with Beth and beaming with pride as he would carry a plate of her Scotcheroos into a meeting or talk about son Andrew's military service and latest adventures.
<br/>
"It was an honor and a privilege to serve alongside Wayne on the North Dakota Industrial Commission and state Land Board. No matter how complex or contentious the issue, we all benefited from his incredible intellect, legal expertise and professionalism. He cared deeply about North Dakota and wanted only the best for its citizens. Kathryn and I extend our deepest condolences and prayers to Beth, Andrew and the entire Stenehjem family, his current and former colleagues from the Attorney General's Office and Legislature, his friends throughout state government and the entire law enforcement community as we grieve this terrible loss."
<br/>
Burgum has directed all government agencies to fly the United States and North Dakota flags at half-staff until further notice and encourages North Dakotans to do the same at their homes and businesses, in honor of Stenehjem and his longtime service to the state.

<br/>
The United States Flag and Maryland State Flag shall be raised to full-staff at sunset tomorrow, Wednesday, February 2, 2022, the day of interment for Lieutenant Paul Butrim, Firefighter/Paramedic Kelsey Sadler, and EMT/Firefighter Kenny Lacayo of the Baltimore City Fire Department, each of whom died in the line of duty on January 24, 2022.

This is to advise that Governor Larry Hogan ordered the United States Flag and Maryland Flag be lowered to half-staff effective immediately and returned to full-staff at sunset on the day of the last interment (date unknown).

This action is in honor of Lieutenant Paul Butrim, Firefighter/Paramedic Kelsey Sadler, and EMT/Firefighter Kenny Lacayo of the Baltimore City Fire Department, each of whom died in the line of duty on January 24, 2022.

Each and every day, our firefighters and first responders answer the call and are ready to run into danger—this is our worst nightmare.
<br/>
"This morning, I spoke to both Mayor Scott and Chief Ford, and at my direction, the State Fire Marshal and the Maryland Department of Emergency Management continue to provide assistance to the city.

Today, Governor Mike Parson ordered U.S. and Missouri flags be flown at half-staff at all government buildings in the City of St. Louis, the Fire Fighters Memorial of Missouri in Kingdom City, and firehouses statewide on Thursday, January 20, from sunrise to sunset in honor of St. Louis Fire Department Firefighter Benjamin James Polson.
<br/>
On January 13, Firefighter Polson was among the firefighters who responded to a fire at a two and a half story brick structure in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood of St. Louis. After conducting a rapid primary search for victims and quickly extinguishing flames on the first floor, Firefighter Polson was among the firefighters who advanced to the second floor to search for victims and continue fighting the blaze. Firefighter Polson was killed when the roof and top story of the structure collapsed, burying him.
<br/>
Polson, 33, had served with the St. Louis Fire Department since November 2019.
<br/>
"Benjamin Polson was a second-generation firefighter with the St. Louis Fire Department who cared about the people with whom he served and those in the community whose lives he touched each day," Governor Parson said. "Firefighter Polson died in the line of duty, willingly taking on risks in a highly dangerous profession so that others in St. Louis could be safer. He will always be remembered as an honorable, dedicated public servant who made the ultimate sacrifice because of his commitment to the well-being of others."
<br/>
The flags will be held at half-staff on the day Firefighter Polson is laid to rest.

Governor Ned Lamont today announced that he is directing U.S. and state flags in Connecticut lowered to half-staff in honor of New Haven Police Officer Diane Gonzalez, who died earlier this week as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty while responding to a domestic violence call on September 9, 2008.
<br/>
Flags should be lowered effective immediately through sunset on the date of interment, which has been scheduled for Wednesday, January 19, 2022. Accordingly, since no flag should fly higher than the U.S. flag, all other flags, including state, municipal, corporate, or otherwise, should also be lowered during this same duration of time.
<br/>
While responding to the domestic violence call, Officer Gonzalez's vehicle collided with another officer's vehicle at a high rate of speed. The other officer, Sergeant Dario "Scott" Aponte, was killed instantly. Officer Gonzalez suffered a traumatic brain injury and slipped into a coma, from which she never emerged.
<br/>
Governor Lamont said, "Officer Gonzalez is a hero, who gave her life in response to a call that someone else was in danger. Her passing is a terrible reminder of the danger that police officers put themselves in each and every day in service to our communities. Officer Gonzalez embodies what it means to lead a life of respect, courage, and integrity, and we will forever remember the sacrifice she made to protect another life. On behalf of the State of Connecticut, I express my deepest condolences to Officer Gonzalez's family, friends, and brothers and sisters in the New Haven Police Department."
<br/>
Lt. Governor Susan Bysiewicz said, "Officer Diane Gonzalez was a dedicated, integral member of the New Haven Police force. As a single mother working the midnight shift, her memory and legacy will serve countless of young women who aspire to join this male-dominated field. My most sincere condolences go to Officer Gonzalez's family, friends, and the New Haven Police Department."

Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy and First Lady Rose Dunleavy extend their deepest sympathies to the family of former Alaska Representative Jules Wright, Department of Commerce Commissioner Julie Anderson's father, who passed away yesterday.
<br/>
"On behalf of the State of Alaska, the First Lady and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the Wright family, and especially to his daughter, Commissioner Julie Anderson," said Governor Dunleavy. "Jules was a man of many talents, and he supported Alaska while wearing many different hats; he was a trucker, contractor, business owner, and State Representative. I urge Alaskans to remember all the years of faithful service Jules gave to our state."
<br/>
After finishing his education, Jules served in the United States Army stationed in Fairbanks. After leaving the army, Jules ran a construction business with his brothers before opening his own, Tundra Contracting. In the early 1960s, Jules served as president of the Fairbanks Native Association (FNA) for three years. He has also served on the board of directors of Doyon Ltd., and in 1966 was elected to a two-year term in the Alaska State House of Representatives. Jules also worked for the Tanana Chiefs Conference as an employment rights officer.
<br/>
Governor Dunleavy has ordered that Alaska state flags and the United States flags fly at half-staff sunrise to sunset on Friday, January 14, 2022, in honor of former Representative Jules Wright.

<br/>
A Proclamation on the Death of Harry Reid
<br/>
From humble roots in Searchlight, Nevada, Harry Reid rose to become one of the great Senate Majority Leaders in American history. He was a man of action, and a man of his word — guided by faith, loyalty, and unshakeable resolve.
<br/>
Throughout his long career of public service, Harry Reid was instrumental in passing landmark legislation that made a positive difference in the lives of countless Americans and made our Nation stronger and safer. His devoted service to our Nation was not about power for power's sake. It was about the power to do right by the American people.
<br/>
As a mark of respect for his memory, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that on the day of his interment, the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on such day. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
<br/>
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.
<br/>
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.

<![CDATA[
On January 6, 2021, insurrectionists rioted at the U.S. Capitol and breached the gates at the Washington State governor's executive residence, purportedly to protest the peaceful transfer of presidential power, a fundamental tenet of our democracy. These acts of violence and intimidation were bravely met by officers of the U.S. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Departments in Washington, D.C, and troopers of the Washington State Patrol in Olympia, Washington. As a result of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, five U.S. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police officers lost their lives on or after January 6, and over 100 were injured.
<br/>
One year later, it is vital that we remember the heroism and sacrifice of those who defended the heart of our democracy and resisted this attempted insurrection last January. The institutions of our democracy depend upon our continued refusal to allow those who would violently attack our system of government and undermine the will of the people to succeed. U.S. and state flags in Washington state, which are already currently lowered to half-staff, shall also now commemorate and honor those officers who were wounded, and whose lives were cut short, as a result of last January's attack on the U.S. Capitol.
<br/>
Additionally, we recognize the Washington Air National Guard and the Washington National Guard, both of which provided personnel for the U.S. Capitol's defense last year, as well as those who joined the Washington State Patrol in protecting the Capitol Campus last year.
<br/>
Please notify all of your field offices and facilities around the state.
<br/>
Other government entities, citizens and businesses are encouraged to join this recognition.

Gov. Jim Justice has issued a proclamation, ordering that all United States and West Virginia flags at the Capitol Complex in Charleston and all state-owned facilities in Wyoming County be displayed at half-staff from dawn to dusk on Thursday, Jan. 6, 2022, in commemoration of the distinguished life and service of former West Virginia Senator Sue Cline.
<br/>
A native of Welch, Cline was elected to the West Virginia State Senate in 2016 after first being appointed to the seat earlier that same year. She went on to serve a full, four-year term, concluding in 2020.
<br/>
Cline also served as Vice President of the Pineville Area Chamber of Commerce, and as a member of the Wyoming County Convention and Visitors Bureau.
<br/>
Upon learning of Cline's passing, Gov. Justice said in a statement, "Sue was a great senator and an even greater friend who will be missed by so many. She will be remembered for her fierce loyalty to the great people of Wyoming County and all those in southern West Virginia.
<br/>
"Cathy and I send our deepest condolences to Sue's family and loved ones as they mourn her untimely death."

Governor Kathy Hochul today announced flags on state buildings will be flown at half-staff on January 6 in honor of the brave Americans who defended the United States Capitol Building during the attempted insurrection of 2021. Flags will be lowered beginning at 2:11 p.m. — the time when the Capitol was first breached — and hoisted to full-staff at 8:06 p.m. — the time the United States Senate reconvened.
<br/>
"The cowardly attacks during the January 6th insurrection last year were more than an assault on the U.S. Capitol building, it was an assault on our democratic values," Governor Hochul said. "We will never be intimidated - democracy will always win. I thank the brave heroes who put their lives on the line to protect public safety on January 6th, and I encourage all of us to reflect on the values with which we built this country: democracy, resiliency, and unity over division."

On January 6, 2021, insurrectionists rioted at the U.S. Capitol and breached the gates at the Washington State governor's executive residence, purportedly to protest the peaceful transfer of presidential power, a fundamental tenet of our democracy. These acts of violence and intimidation were bravely met by officers of the U.S. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Departments in Washington, D.C, and troopers of the Washington State Patrol in Olympia, Washington. As a result of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, five U.S. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police officers lost their lives on or after January 6, and over 100 were injured.
<br/>
One year later, it is vital that we remember the heroism and sacrifice of those who defended the heart of our democracy and resisted this attempted insurrection last January. The institutions of our democracy depend upon our continued refusal to allow those who would violently attack our system of government and undermine the will of the people to succeed. U.S. and state flags in Washington state, which are already currently lowered to half-staff, shall also now commemorate and honor those officers who were wounded, and whose lives were cut short, as a result of last January's attack on the U.S. Capitol.
<br/>
Additionally, we recognize the Washington Air National Guard and the Washington National Guard, both of which provided personnel for the U.S. Capitol's defense last year, as well as those who joined the Washington State Patrol in protecting the Capitol Campus last year.
<br/>
Please notify all of your field offices and facilities around the state.
<br/>
Other government entities, citizens and businesses are encouraged to join this recognition.

Gov. Jim Justice has issued a proclamation, ordering that all United States and West Virginia flags at the Capitol Complex in Charleston and all state-owned facilities in Wyoming County be displayed at half-staff from dawn to dusk on Thursday, Jan. 6, 2022, in commemoration of the distinguished life and service of former West Virginia Senator Sue Cline.
<br/>
A native of Welch, Cline was elected to the West Virginia State Senate in 2016 after first being appointed to the seat earlier that same year. She went on to serve a full, four-year term, concluding in 2020.
<br/>
Cline also served as Vice President of the Pineville Area Chamber of Commerce, and as a member of the Wyoming County Convention and Visitors Bureau.
<br/>
Upon learning of Cline's passing, Gov. Justice said in a statement, "Sue was a great senator and an even greater friend who will be missed by so many. She will be remembered for her fierce loyalty to the great people of Wyoming County and all those in southern West Virginia.
<br/>
"Cathy and I send our deepest condolences to Sue's family and loved ones as they mourn her untimely death."
