{"state":"United States","date":"2022-05-15","reason":"A Proclamation on Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2022\n\n For generations, courageous men and women of our Nationâs law enforcement community have dedicated their lives to protecting us in big cities, small towns, and suburban neighborhoods across America. Each morning, police officers pin on their shield and walk out the door to go to work, hoping they will come home safely. Last year, a record number of law enforcement officers died in the line of duty. On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we express our gratitude for these selfless public servants who put themselves in harmâs way to keep us safe and honor those who lost their lives in the line of duty.\n\nAs we see a rise in gun violence and other violent crimes, it is critical that we fund law enforcement with the resources and training they need to do their jobs safely and effectively. That is why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 billion that cities, States, counties, and tribes can use to hire more police officers and invest in proven strategies like community violence intervention, youth programming, and other supportive services. It is also why my proposed 2023 budget more than doubles funding for effective community policing through the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Program. In addition, my budget increases support for the United States Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, so they can apprehend fugitives and fight illegal gun trafficking.\n\nGun violence not only affects community members, it also targets law enforcement officers. Last month at the White House, surrounded by law enforcment, community leaders, and families who have lost loved ones to gun violence, we announced that the Department of Justice is reining in the proliferation of âghost gunsâ â privately-made firearms without serial numbers that are increasingly showing up on our streets and being used to attack law enforcement officers and members of the public.\n\nMy Administration is also committed to supporting programs that protect the physical safety of our law enforcement â more bulletproof vests, active shooter trainings, and early warnings of threats targeting officers. We must also do more to protect our officersâ mental health and emotional well-being. Suicide and COVID-19 were among the leading causes of death for law enforcement officers in 2021. Last November, I was proud to sign into law three bills that extend critical peer counseling and mental health resources for officers, expand eligibility and benefits for first responders disabled in the line of duty, and protect Federal law enforcement serving abroad. Our officers swear an oath to protect us, and we owe them the same pledge.\n\nWe must not abandon our streets or accept the false choice between public safety and equal justice. The solution is not to defund our police. It is to make our streets more secure through policing that treats everyone with dignity and respect. It is to provide officers with the resources, tools, and training they need to keep our neighborhoods safe.\n\nDuring Police Week, let us demonstrate our appreciation for the unsung heroes who nobly wear the badge and put their lives at risk to protect people each and every day. Let us honor the brave officers whose bright futures were cut short in the line of duty. Let us come together to help police be the partners and protectors our communities and our Nation need for a safer, more just America.\n\nBy a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as âPeace Officers Memorial Dayâ and the week in which it falls as âPolice Week.â\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2022, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 15 through May 21, 2022, as Police Week. I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities and salute our Nationâs brave law enforcement officers and remember their peace officer brothers and sisters who have given their last full measure of devotion in the line of duty. I also call on the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\nthirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.\r\n\nJOSEPH R.

Having grown up poor in Slaughter Beach, she brought that perspective to her job every day, and she never lost her attachment to those roots.\n\nâGovernor Minner was also a trailblazer, becoming Delawareâs first female Governor when she was elected in 2000 and paving the way for women and girls in our state to seek out leadership roles. Her path to the Governorâs office was a unique one. Widowed in her early 30s, Governor Minner served as a legislative aide in the General Assembly, and a receptionist to Governor Sherman Tribbitt, before beginning her own political career. She was elected to her first of four terms in the Delaware House of Representatives in 1974. Governor Minner went on to serve three terms in the Delaware Senate, and two as Lieutenant Governor, before winning two terms as Governor.\n\nâDuring her time in office, Governor Minner worked with legislators of both parties to improve health care and fight cancer, strengthen our education system, and attract good jobs to our state. She will be greatly missed. Tracey and I are praying for Governor Minnerâs family, and her many friends across our state, during this difficult time.â"}

He believed in the promise of America because he lived it. And he devoted much of his life to making that promise a reality for so many others. He embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat. He led with his personal commitment to the democratic values that make our country strong. He repeatedly broke racial barriers, blazing a trail for others to follow, and was committed throughout his life to investing in the next generation of leadership. Colin Powell was a good man who I was proud to call my friend, and he will be remembered in history as one of our great Americans.\n\nAs a mark of respect for General Powell and his life of service to our Nation, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on October 22, 2021.

BIDEN JR.\n\nStatement of President Joe Biden on the Passing of General Colin Powell\n\nJill and I are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and a patriot of unmatched honor and dignity, General Colin Powell.\n\nThe son of immigrants, born in New York City, raised in Harlem and the South Bronx, a graduate of the City College of New York, he rose to the highest ranks of the United States military and to advise four presidents. He believed in the promise of America because he lived it. And he devoted much of his life to making that promise a reality for so many others.\n\nAs a Senator, I worked closely with him when he served as National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and as Secretary of State. Over our many years working together â even in disagreement â Colin was always someone who gave you his best and treated you with respect.\n\nColin embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat. He was committed to our nationâs strength and security above all. Having fought in wars, he understood better than anyone that military might alone was not enough to maintain our peace and prosperity. From his front-seat view of history, advising presidents and shaping our nationâs policies, Colin led with his personal commitment to the democratic values that make our country strong. Time and again, he put country before self, before party, before all elseâin uniform and outâand it earned him the universal respect of the American people.\n\nHaving repeatedly broken racial barriers, blazing a trail for others to follow in Federal Government service, Colin was committed throughout his life to investing in the next generation of leadership. Whether through his care for the women and men serving under his command and the diplomats he led, or through the work he shared with his wife Alma at the Americaâs Promise Alliance to lift up young people, or through his years leading the Eisenhower Fellowships, Colinâs leadership always included a focus on future.\n\nAbove all, Colin was my friend. Easy to share a laugh with. A trusted confidant in good and hard times. He could drive his Corvette Stingray like nobodyâs businessâsomething I learned firsthand on the race track when I was Vice President. And I am forever grateful for his support of my candidacy for president and for our shared battle for the soul of the nation.

{"state":"United States","date":"2021-10-03","reason":"A Proclamation on Fire Prevention Week, 2021\n\nDuring Fire Prevention Week, we honor our brave firefighters and first responders who risk their lives to protect us every day and reaffirm the importance of fire safety and preparedness. This week, I call on all Americans to educate themselves about fire prevention and safety and recommit to taking the necessary steps to prevent fires. Whether you are in your own home or camping in one of Americaâs majestic National Parks, taking the proper precautions and safety measures can help prevent fires and save your life and the lives of your family and others while protecting our natural wonders.\n\nAlready this year, more than 44,000 wildfires have burned nearly 5.3 million acres of our land â an area roughly the size of the State of New Jersey. These fires have destroyed homes and priceless memories. They have forced families into shelters and filled the air with smoke for hundreds of miles. Precious lives have been lost. The fires have ground local economies to a halt, swallowed up family farms, and disrupted supply chains that fuel jobs, businesses, and communities all across the country.\n\nThese fires represent a code red for our Nation â and we know that, unless we take bold action to address climate change, they will only continue to gain in frequency and ferocity. Scientists have warned us for years that extreme weather will only get more extreme, and today we are living it in real time. Extreme weather, including wildfires, cost America $99 billion last year; unfortunately, we are poised to break that record this year.\n\nThat is why my Administration is committed to taking on the threat of climate change and investing in Americaâs resilience. We have proposed investing billions of dollars to strengthen our wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response. These investments will not just save lives and homes â they will also save industries and create new jobs. When I think about climate change, I always think about the millions of good-paying, union jobs we can create â but we also need to think about all of the jobs and industries we stand to lose if we fail to act boldly enough. The evidence is overwhelming that every dollar we invest in our resilience saves us six dollars down the road, when the next fire does not spread as widely and homes and businesses are spared.\n\nOur response to this threat starts with our brave firefighters, who put their lives on the line every day. To better support the wildland firefighters who serve our Nation so courageously, my Administration is committed to making sure that we have enough firefighters on call who are trained, equipped, and ready to respond. That is why I took action this summer to ensure that all of our Federal firefighters will earn a minimum of $15 an hour. My Administration has increased wildland firefighter pay through bonuses and retention pay, extended seasonal firefighter employment to ensure robust response throughout the fire season, deployed new fire detection and air monitoring technologies, invoked the Defense Production Act to increase the supply of equipment, and brought additional aircraft and personnel to bear from both the Department of Defense and our partner nations.\n\nDuring Fire Prevention Week, I call on all Americans to educate themselves about fire safety, take the appropriate precautions when encountering fires, and honor our courageous firefighters, volunteers, and first responders. I also encourage everyone to install and maintain smoke alarms in their homes â critical elements of fire safety that have helped significantly decrease United States home fire death rates over the past 40 years. By testing alarms every month and replacing them every 10 years, we can be better prepared to respond quickly to fires and prevent tragic loss of life.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 3 through October 9, 2021, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 3, 2021, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.\n\nOn October 16, 2001, President George W. Bush signed legislation asking that the American flag to be lowered to half-staff on all Federal buildings to honor fallen firefighters.\n\nThe resulting Public Law 107-51 involves this action to occur every year in conjunction with observance of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service weekend which is October 3-5, 2020.\n\nTo be clear, the actual flag lowering should be done on the last day, which is the 5th. This doesn't mean that it only applies to Federal buildings, everyone is encouraged to join in this observance. Individual state Governors will most likely make their own proclamations and so will the President of the United States of America."}

{"state":"United States","date":"2021-09-11","reason":"By a joint resolution approved Dec. 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89) has designated Sept. 11 of each year as \"Patriot Day,\" which also directs the flags be lowered to half-staff for the entire day on Sept. 11.\n\nA Proclamation on Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, 2021\n\nTwenty years ago, the United States endured one of the most unconscionable tragedies in our countryâs history. The cowardly terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and onboard United Flight 93 cut short the lives of 2,977 innocent people. These attacks tore a hole in the heart of our Nation, and the pain of this tragedy still remains. Each year on this somber date, we remember the horror and bravery shown that day, just as we remember how we came together, united in grief and in purpose. Each year, we renew our solemn vow to never forget what happened on September 11, 2001, or those who lost their lives.\n\nOn Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, we honor every life that was taken too soon. We honor the first responders â firefighters, law enforcement officers, emergency workers, and service members â who answered the call of duty, and the brave civilians who rushed into action to save lives that day. Their courage embodies the American spirit and resilience, and their heroism continues to inspire new generations of Americans.\n\nMy mother used to say that âcourage lies in every heart, and one day it will be summoned.â It was summoned and shown by those who responded to the events on 9/11. First responders, emergency workers, and civilians ran to where the devastation was the greatest, where death came in an instant but where there were survivors to be found; a determined group of heroes onboard United Flight 93 sacrificed their lives to save the lives of others â in every case, Americans faced the unimaginable with resolve and courage. Today and every day, we draw hope from the strength and selflessness of those who stepped up to serve their fellow man and our Nation on that tragic day.\n\nWe also remember the patriotism and valor of our service members who pursued our attackers, delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, and degraded al-Qaâida. We will keep our sacred obligation to care for our service members and veterans who served in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, as well as their families, caregivers, and survivors.\n\nOver the last two decades the American people have demonstrated that the harder the circumstances, the more resilient and stronger we become. Our shared love of country and our shared values â regardless of race, gender, religion, origin, or economic status â unite us as Americans against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n\nToday, on this Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, we move forward as one Nation, united by our common goal of liberty and justice for all. We remember those killed on September 11, 2001, and honor them through acts of service. I encourage all Americans to visit americorps.gov/911-day to learn about and seek opportunities to serve others on this day and to demonstrate once again that the ideals we hold, which many have tried to attack and destroy, are the very bonds that hold us together â even tighter in times of peril.\n\nBy a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as âPatriot Day,â and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized âNational Day of Service and Remembrance.â\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2021, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\n\ntenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.\n\nA Proclamation on National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2021\n\nTwenty years ago, our Nation was forever changed. On September 11, 2001, as ordinary people started their days in Manhattan, Shanksville, and Arlington, cowardly acts born out of twisted hate stole 2,977 innocent lives, devastating families and communities. People across the world were shocked by the cruelty and horror of the terrorist act, even as they were inspired by the bravery of the first responders. Two decades have passed since that day of terror, yet the trauma, the pain, and the quest for justice â both personal and collective â still haunt our memories. Planes piercing buildings. Smoke filling skies. Towers turning to dust. The injured fleeing to safety. The heroes rushing toward danger.\n\nDuring the National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we honor those who lost their lives on September 11 â lives that will never be forgotten. We also commemorate the humanity and selfless sacrifice of the first responders, service members, and ordinary citizens who banded together to rescue survivors and build a community of support around those who suffered unimaginable loss. Even as we continue to recover from this tragedy, we know for certain that there is nothing that America cannot overcome. Through sorrow, with Godâs help, we find strength. Through remembrance, in Godâs mercy, we find healing. We move forward with resolve, forever cherishing the memories of the souls who perished that day.\n\nThe seeds of chaos, planted that September by those who wished to harm us, blossomed instead into fields of hope for a brighter future. A new generation of patriots â many of whom were just children on that bright September morning, some of whom had not yet been born â now serve in our Armed Forces, as law enforcement officers and firefighters, as paramedics, in the halls of our Federal buildings, and beyond, determined to build our country back better, safer, and more united.\n\nDuring these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we solemnly reflect on the freedom and tolerance that are part of our American character. We commit to preserving the memories of our fallen loved ones with the same tenacity with which we uphold the American values that are the root of our strength. We pray for the victims and all those who still mourn their loss. May the power of prayer bring comfort, and may God bless the United States of America.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 10, 2021, through September 12, 2021, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. I ask that people of the United States honor and remember the victims of September 11, 2001, and their loved ones through prayer, contemplation, memorial services, the visiting of memorials, the ringing of bells, evening candlelight remembrance vigils, and other appropriate ceremonies and activities. I invite people around the world to participate in this commemoration. I invite the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, for our many freedoms and blessings, and I join all people of faith in prayers for spiritual guidance, mercy, and protection.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth.\n\nJOSEPH R.

{"state":"Kentucky","date":"2021-07-31","reason":"Gov. Andy Beshear recognizes the sacrifice of a Somerset sailor who died on the USS Oklahoma in the attack on Pearl Harbor but whose remains were not identified until last year.\n\nâFor almost 80 years, families of the sailors who died on the Oklahoma could mourn their sons and fathers, brothers and husbands only at a distance,â said Gov. Andy Beshear. âBut thanks to the meticulous, persistent work of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, Kentucky sailors are finally coming home.â\n\nNavy Seaman 2nd Class Floyd D. Helton, 18, of Somerset, Kentucky, died on Dec. 7, 1941. Helton was assigned to the battleship USS Oklahoma, which was moored at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, when the ship was attacked by Japanese aircraft. The USS Oklahoma sustained multiple torpedo hits, which quickly caused it to capsize. The attack on the ship resulted in the deaths of 429 crewmen, including Helton.\n\nFrom December 1941 to June 1944, Navy personnel recovered the remains of the deceased crew, which were subsequently interred in the Halawa and Nuâuanu Cemeteries.\n\nIn September 1947, tasked with recovering and identifying fallen U.S. personnel in the Pacific Theater, members of the American Graves Registration Service (AGRS) disinterred the remains of U.S. casualties from the two cemeteries and transferred them to the Central Identification Laboratory at Schofield Barracks. The laboratory staff was only able to confirm the identifications of 35 men from the USS Oklahoma at that time. The AGRS subsequently buried the unidentified remains in 46 plots at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu. In October 1949, a military board classified those who could not be identified as non-recoverable, including Helton.\n\nBetween June and November 2015, Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) personnel exhumed the USS Oklahoma unknowns from the Punchbowl for analysis.\n\nTo identify Heltonâs remains, scientists from DPAA used dental and anthropological analysis. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used Y chromosome DNA (Y-STR) and autosomal DNA (auSTR) analysis.\n\nHeltonâs name is recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the Punchbowl, along with the others who are missing from World War II. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.\n\nHelton will be buried July 31, 2021, in Burnside, Kentucky. Gov. Beshear will order flags lowered to half-staff in honor of Seaman 2nd Class Helton on the day of his interment."}

On this fateful day, six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Dutch Harbor on Amaknak Island was bombed by Japanese âKateâ bombers from two of their aircraft carriers, marking the first aerial attack by an enemy on the continental United States; and\n\nWHEREAS, the pilots expected little resistance, but a secret message warning of the attack had been intercepted three weeks before, and since late May the installation had been on high alert. Navy and Marine personnel were ready and filled the air with anti-aircraft fire; and\n\nWHEREAS, due to the counter attack from the Dutch Harbor installation, the Japanese instead focused their attack on the Margaret Bay Naval barracks, killing 25 servicemen; and\n\nWHEREAS, this attack on Dutch Harbor was the first hostile action on Alaskan soil, but not the last. In the days and weeks that followed, Dutch Harbor was again attacked, as was Adak, Kiska, and Attu. The Unangan (Aleut) people were uprooted from their homes and evacuated with few personal belongings. For three long years they were held in internment camps in Southeast Alaska, and as a result of the horrific conditions of the camps, many perished. Kiska and Attu were invaded and held by the Japanese, with prisoners taken and lives lost; and\n\nWHEREAS, the brave men of the United States Armed Forces and allied Canadian Forces fought the enemy in severe weather conditions for over a year in order to retake the remaining Aleutian Islands. The battle for Attu ranks as one of the United Statesâ most costly assaults in the Pacific during the war, as hundreds of American servicemen made the ultimate sacrifice to liberate Alaska; and\n\nWHEREAS, this year marks the 79th Anniversary of the bombing of Dutch Harbor. We remember and honor all those who were affected by the attack, commemorating both the military personnel who served and died to defend our nation, and the Aleuts who died while imprisoned.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Mike Dunleavy, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF ALASKA, do hereby proclaim June 3, 2021 as:\n\nDutch Harbor Remembrance Day\n\nin Alaska, and encourage all Alaskans to join with the people of Dutch Harbor, Unalaska, and the Aleutian Islands to honor all who were lost in Alaska during World War II, and order the Alaska State Flag to be flown at half-staff in remembrance of those who perished."}

However humble or unknown, they (the veterans) have renounced what are accounted pleasures and cheerfully undertaken all self-denials; privations, toils, dangers, sufferings, sicknesses, mutilations, life-long hurts and losses, death itself. For some great good, dimly seen but dearly held.\"\n\n- Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain\n\nLet's Honor Those Who Made the Ultimate Sacrifice\n\nOn Memorial Day the American flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff. All subordinate flags will fly below the level of the American flag.\n\nA Proclamation: Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2021\n\nOn Memorial Day, we honor and reflect upon the courage, integrity, and selfless dedication of the members of our Armed Forces who have made the greatest sacrifice in service to our Nation. Whether in the waters of the Pacific, on the beachheads of Europe, in the deserts of the Middle East, or in the mountains of Afghanistan, American service members have given their lives to uphold our Constitution and to defend the safety and freedoms of our citizens. These patriots embody the best of the American spirit. They put themselves on the line for our shared values â for duty, honor, country â and they paid the ultimate price. Our Nation can never fully repay the debt we owe to our fallen heroes and their families.\n\nJill and I know what it means to have a child serving in a war zone â the ever-present concern for your loved one and their fellow service members. Today and every day, we ask God to protect our troops. We also recognize the tremendous loss endured by Americaâs Gold Star families â the families of military members who died in conflict. We have a sacred obligation as a Nation to support those families and to always honor the memories of their loved ones.\n\nThat is the vow we make each year on Memorial Day. Our Nation will never forget the courage and patriotism demonstrated by the countless women and men who laid down their lives so that we may continue to pursue a more perfect Union and to protect the unalienable rights Americans hold dear. They came from every part of the country, of every background and belief, united by a shared belief in our uniquely American creed â that all people are created equal. We will honor their legacy by continuing our work to live up to that commitment and to advance the values they lived and died to defend. We will continue to fight for equity and inclusion in our country and institutions, and ensure every qualified American who is willing to serve our country â regardless of race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or background â has a fair and equal opportunity to do so.\n\nWe will continue to honor our fallen service members through the actions of a new generation who volunteer to serve in uniform, who anchor our military to our democratic values, and who stand ready to deter aggression from our enemies and, if required, fight and defend our Nation. Today â as we keep true to the memory of our fallen heroes â we will endeavor to meet their legacy and once more lead the world through the power of our example and not just the example of our power.\n\nAs our Nationâs service members continue to risk their lives to protect our homeland and thwart our enemies, we must not lose sight of our desire for enduring peace. Every day, countless Americans pray and work for peace so that we may one day live in a world where American patriots need not make the ultimate sacrifice, and where all people live in freedom and prosperity. As a Nation, we are grateful to the brave members of our Armed Services â both past and present â who have forged the legacy for that possibility.\n\nIn honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested that the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer and reflection. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R.

I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance. I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.\n\nI request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control.

Flags at the White House and Federal Capitol have been returned to full-staff.\n\nA Proclamation on the Death of Walter Mondale\n\nAPRIL 20, 2021\n\nToday, our Nation mourns the loss of one of our Nationâs most dedicated patriots and public servants. Walter Frederick âFritzâ Mondale served the people of Minnesota as their Attorney General from 1960-1964, as a United States Senator from 1964-1976, as Vice President of the United States from 1977-1981, and as the United States Ambassador to Japan from 1993-1996.\n\nAs Minnesotaâs Attorney General, he drew national attention in a landmark case before the U.S. Supreme Court that established that indigent criminal defendants have the right to legal counsel.\n\nAs a Senator, he was instrumental in the passage of The Fair Housing Act to combat racial discrimination in housing, Title IX to provide more opportunities for women, and numerous laws to protect our environment.\n\nWalter Mondale defined the modern vice presidency, elevating the position into a true partnership with the President. As Vice President, he helped lay the groundwork for the 1978 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, the Panama Canal Treaty, and nuclear arms negotiations with the Soviet Union.\n\nAs the 1984 Democratic nominee for President, he made history when he became the first Presidential nominee of either party to select a woman as his running mate.\n\nIn continuing his service as the United States Ambassador to Japan, he became the voice and face of America to that important ally.\n\nFor nearly 60 years he had a remarkable partnership with his wife Joan, a devoted advocate for the arts, who passed away in 2014. We mourned when he lost his daughter Eleanor in 2011 and today our Nationâs sympathies lie with his sons Ted and William and his six grandchildren.\n\nOn a wall at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia, there is a quote from Walter Mondale. It reads, âWe told the truth. We obeyed the law. We kept the peace.â Walter Mondale did all that and more.\n\nAs a mark of respect for Walter Mondale and his life of service to our Nation, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 7 of title 4, United States Code, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, on the day of interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.\n\nStatement from President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden on the Passing of Walter Mondale\n\nItâs with great sadness that Jill and I learned of the passing of Vice President Walter Mondale, but great gratitude that we were able to call one of our nationâs most dedicated patriots and public servants a dear friend and mentor.\n\nJill and I had the opportunity to speak to Fritz and his family over the weekend, to reflect on the years of friendship we shared, and how much we learned from and leaned on each other.\n\nWhen I arrived in the United States Senate in 1973, Walter Mondale was one of the first people to greet me. Through his work as a Senator, he showed me what was possible. He may have been modest and unassuming in manner, but he was unwavering in his pursuit of progress; instrumental in passing laws like the Fair Housing Act to prevent racial discrimination in housing, Title IX to provide more opportunities for women, and laws to protect our environment. There have been few senators, before or since, who commanded such universal respect.\n\nWhen President Obama asked me to consider being his Vice President, Fritz was my first call and trusted guide. He not only took my call, he wrote me a memo. It was Walter Mondale who defined the vice presidency as a full partnership, and helped provide a model for my service.\n\nAnd Joan did the same for Jill, helping her carve out a role for herself as our nationâs Second Lady.\n\nHe not only created a path for himself, he helped others do the same. Walter Mondale was the first presidential nominee of either party to select a woman as his running mate, and I know how pleased he was to be able to see Kamala Harris become Vice President.\n\nIn accepting the Democratic Partyâs nomination for President, he described the values he was taught to live by: âto play by the rules; to tell the truth; to obey the law; to care for others; to love our country; to cherish our faith.â\n\nAs a Senator, an Ambassador, a Vice President, and a candidate for President, he lived and spread those values.\n\nOur hearts go out to the Mondale family. And we take some comfort in the fact that he is with Joan and Eleanor now."}

And it came just the night before 14th anniversary of the shooting at Virginia Tech, in which a gunman murdered 32 people.\n\nLast night and into the morning in Indianapolis, yet again families had to wait to hear word about the fate of their loved ones. What a cruel wait and fate that has become too normal and happens every day somewhere in our nation.\n\nGun violence is an epidemic in America. But we should not accept it. We must act.\n\nLast week, I called on the Justice Department to better protect Americans from gun violence. I also urged Congress to hear the call of the American people â including the vast majority of gun owners â to enact commonsense gun violence prevention legislation, like universal background checks and a ban of weapons of war and high-capacity magazines.\n\nToo many Americans are dying every single day from gun violence.

He and his men killed 26 enemy soldiers and wounded 60. Coolidge was our countryâs second-to-last living WWII Medal of Honor recipient. His body will be interred on Friday, April 16.\n\nWe have copied his citation from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society below:\n\nLeading a section of heavy machine guns supported by one platoon of Company K, he took a position near Hill 623, east of Belmont-sur-Buttant, France, 24 October 1944, with the mission of covering the right flank of the 3d Battalion and supporting its action. TSgt. Coolidge went forward with a sergeant of Company K to reconnoiter positions for coordinating the fires of the light and heavy machine guns. They ran into an enemy force in the woods estimated to be an infantry company. TSgt. Coolidge, attempting to bluff the Germans by a show of assurance and boldness, called upon them to surrender, whereupon the enemy opened fire. With his carbine, TSgt. Coolidge wounded two of them. There being no officer present with the force, TSgt. Coolidge at once assumed command. Many of the men were replacements recently arrived; this was their first experience under fire. TSgt. Coolidge, unmindful of the enemy fire delivered at close range, walked along the position, calming and encouraging his men and directing their fire. The attack was thrown back. Through 24 and 26 October the enemy launched repeated attacks against the position of this combat group but each was repulsed due to TSgt. Coolidge's able leadership. On 27 October, German infantry, supported by two tanks, made a determined attack on the position. The area was swept by enemy small-arms, machine-gun, and tank fire. TSgt. Coolidge armed himself with a bazooka and advanced within 25 yards of the tanks. His bazooka failed to function and he threw it aside. Securing all the hand grenades he could carry, he crawled forward and inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing enemy. Finally it became apparent that the enemy, in greatly superior force, supported by tanks, would overrun the position. TSgt. Coolidge, displaying great coolness and courage, directed and conducted an orderly withdrawal, being himself the last to leave the position. As a result of TSgt. Coolidge's heroic and superior leadership, the mission of his combat group was accomplished throughout four days of continuous fighting against numerically superior enemy troops in rain and cold and amid dense woods."}

Tragically, 2,403 Americans perished during the attack, including 68 civilians. On this National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we solemnly honor and uphold the memory of the patriots who lost their lives that day -- \"a date which will live in infamy\" -- and we reflect on the courage of all those who served our Nation with honor in the Second World War.\n\nSeventy nine years ago, Imperial Japan launched an unprovoked and devastating attack on our Nation. As torpedo bombers unleashed their deadly cargo on our ships and attack aircraft rained bombs from above, brave members of the United States Navy, Marines, Army, and Army Air Forces mounted a heroic defense, manning their battle stations and returning fire through the smoke and chaos. The profound bravery in the American resistance surprised Japanese aircrews and inspired selfless sacrifice among our service members. In one instance, Machinist's Mate First Class Robert R. Scott, among 15 Sailors awarded the Medal of Honor for acts of valor on that day, refused to leave his flooding battle station within the depths of the USS CALIFORNIA, declaring to the world: \"This is my station and I will stay and give them air as long as the guns are going.\"\n\nForever enshrined in our history, the attack on Pearl Harbor shocked all Americans and galvanized our Nation to fight and defeat the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy. As Americans, we promise never to forget our fallen compatriots who fought so valiantly during World War II. As a testament to their memory, more than a million people visit the site of the USS ARIZONA Memorial each year to pay their respects to the Sailors entombed within its wreckage and to all who perished that day. Despite facing tremendous adversity, the Pacific Fleet, whose homeport remains at Pearl Harbor to this day, is stronger than ever before, upholding the legacy of all those who gave their lives nearly 80 years ago.\n\nOn this National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we recall the phrase \"Remember Pearl Harbor,\" which stirred the fighting spirit within the hearts of the more than 16 million Americans who courageously served in World War II. Over 400,000 gave their lives in the global conflict that began, for our Nation, on that fateful Sunday morning. Today, we memorialize all those lost on December 7, 1941, declare once again that our Nation will never forget these valiant heroes, and resolve as firmly as ever that their memory and spirit will survive for as long as our Nation endures.\n\nThe Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as \"National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.\"\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2020, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\n\nfourth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.\n\nDONALD J TRUMP"}

{"state":"United States","date":"2020-11-11","reason":"On Veterans Day we honor all people who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces by flying the flag at full-staff. Veterans Day should not be confused with Memorial Day. Memorial Day is a day of remembrance for those who have died while serving our country. New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania are still observing half-staff for victims of Covid-19.\n\nPresident Trump's Proclamation on Veterans Day, 2020\n\nAmericaâs veterans have fought to defend our country, its values, and its interests since the first days of our founding. They have defeated tyrants, eliminated terrorists, and secured freedom at home and abroad. Their courage and fortitude in the face of adversity serve as an example for all Americans. On Veterans Day, we pause to pay tribute to all who have proudly worn our Nationâs uniform. These Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen selflessly placed lives, wellâbeing, and security of others before their own. We enjoy the privileges of peace, prosperity, and freedom because of our veterans, and we are forever indebted to them beyond measure.\n\nFor their love of country and dedication to duty, Americaâs veterans have endured adversity, loneliness, fatigue, loss, and made other incredible sacrifices. Many sustained life-altering physical injuries and disabilities; others bear the burden of emotional scars for the remainder of their lives. Our Nationâs veterans fully understand libertyâs high and precious cost, for they have paid it every day since the formation of our Republic.\n\nAs Commander in Chief, I have relentlessly fought to support Americaâs veterans. For far too long, our Government had not fully met its obligation to provide for âhim who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.â I recognize that this country and its people are duty-bound to care for our exceptional veterans, their families, and their survivors. That is why, throughout my time in office, I have worked tirelessly to improve the health, welfare, and economic prosperity of these treasured people. In just a few short years, my Administration completely overhauled the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), removing employees who were not giving our veterans the care and attention they deserve and making the agency more accountable to the heroes it serves. I also signed into law the VA MISSION Act, which gives eligible veterans the choice to receive timely care from providers in their own communities. In 2018, I also signed the largest funding bill in the history of the VA, and the VA has since benefited from record budgets every year. In addition, I signed a Presidential Memorandum to ensure that veterans who are totally and permanently disabled receive the Federal student loan forgiveness to which they are so justly entitled. We will continue to build on these efforts and work to create an economic environment that fosters growth and prosperity for veterans, ensuring all of our veterans have the opportunity to live productive civilian lives.\n\nThe mental health and welfare of our veterans is of critical importance, and addressing this issue has been a top priority. Tragically, an average of 20 veterans and service members die by suicide each day. We are striving with all our effort to end this alarming and unacceptable reality. Last year, I launched the largest whole-of-government program in history to end veteran suicide, the Presidentâs Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS). I also recently signed the Commander John Scott Hannon Veteran Mental Health Care Improvement Act which is strengthening VA mental health, supporting suicide prevention efforts, and developing pilot programs dedicated to ending veteran suicide. I have also bolstered the Veterans Crisis Line, so that its around-the-clock operators can deliver the best possible intervention services to vulnerable veterans.\n\nOur veterans represent the best of America, and they deserve the best America can provide them. To recognize and respect the contributions our service men and women have made in defense of America, and to advance the cause of peace, the Congress has provided, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. 6103(a), that November 11th of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to recognize Americaâs veterans. These heroes served faithfully, humbly, and valiantly in times of war and peace, and they carried these admirable traits into the civilian workforce when their military service was fulfilled. Our precious liberty has survived and thrived because of generations of brave Americans â from every background and walk of life â who have answered the call to support and defend the United States. The gravity of their contribution is immeasurable and so is our debt to every single one of our Nationâs veterans.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2020, as Veterans Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the fortitude and sacrifice of our veterans through public ceremonies and private thoughts and prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities to support this day with commemorative expressions and programs.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP"}

Please, honor the 1,000 lives we have already lost in our state, honor their grieving loved ones by recommitting to common-sense, life-saving public health practices. Stay home.

{"state":"United States","date":"2020-10-04","reason":"President Trump's Official Proclamation\n\nDuring Fire Prevention Week, we are reminded to keep doing our part to prevent fires before they tragically claim lives and destroy homes, businesses, and natural resources. Every American can play a role in raising awareness about preventing fires and taking simple precautions to help prevent fire-related deaths and injuries. We also commend our Nationâs brave firefighters and emergency workers who risk their health and safety each day, and we solemnly remember those who gave their lives in service to protect Americans and our communities. This week, I encourage all Americans to take steps to prepare their family, property, and community on what to do before, during, and after a fire.\n\nThis year, courageous firefighters and other brave Americans have confronted one of the worst fire seasons in our history. We have seen more than 43,500 wildfires, lost more than 10,000 buildings, and 35 people have tragically died. In the Western States, more than 30,000 firefighters â the largest deployment in history â have battled these fires, risking their lives for their fellow Americansâ safety. My Administration is thankful for the assistance from our National Guard, Navy, Marine Corps, and international partners from Canada and Mexico to help end this devastation.\n\nThis tragic fire season is another reminder of the importance of effective forest management, which can play a big role in helping prevent forest fires. Proactive steps such as cleaning forest floors to remove flammable limbs and leaves can help reduce the risk of large fires and improve the health of our Nationâs forests. In 2020, I have approved more than 30 Stafford Act Declarations, including Fire Management Assistance Grants, to help multiple States stop fires, and we continue to encourage active forest management efforts throughout the country.\n\nThis year, we also give special recognition to the many American firefighters who joined the valiant efforts of our Australian allies in fighting bushfires that killed hundreds of people and countless animals and destroyed thousands of homes. Tragically, three Americans perished in this courageous effort. These heroes, all veterans of the United States Armed Forces, embodied the very best of the American spirit in their desire to help others, and we will always honor their memory.\n\nHome fires are also a cause for significant concern. Cooking fires are one of the most common types of residential fires, and fires in the home can start easily if the right precautions are not taken. I recommend that Americans take active steps to protect themselves and their families at home, including by testing smoke alarms once a month and replacing them after 10 years, as recommended by the United States Fire Administration. Additionally, it is important to have a fire escape route in place so all are prepared for how to leave the home if a fire does occur. We can all do our part to prevent fires in and around our homes to protect the lives of our families and neighbors.\n\nThroughout this Fire Prevention Week, we come together to recognize the threat posed by fire, honor the lives it claims each year, and recommit to preventing fires in our homes, businesses, and across this great Nationâs wildlands. I encourage all Americans to reduce fire deaths, injuries, and property loss through prudent preparation.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 4 through October 10, 2020, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 4, 2020, in accordance with Public Law 107â51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n\nOn October 16, 2001, President George W. Bush signed legislation asking that the American flag to be lowered to half-staff on all Federal buildings to honor fallen firefighters.\n\nThe resulting Public Law 107-51 involves this action to occur every year in conjunction with observance of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service weekend which is October 3-5, 2020.\n\nTo be clear, the actual flag lowering should be done on the last day, which is the 5th. This doesn't mean that it only applies to Federal buildings, everyone is encouraged to join in this observance. Individual state Governors will most likely make their own proclamations and so will the President of the United States of America."}

Ruth Bader Ginsburg served more than 27 years as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She was a loving wife to her late husband Martin, and a caring mother to her two children Jane and James.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg was an inspiration to all Americans. Having lost her older sister and mother before graduating high school, she entered law school as both a wife and a mother, and one of the few women in her class. After graduating from law school in 1959, she worked tirelessly for more than 34 years as a litigator and jurist and, in 1993, she became just the second woman to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States. Renowned for her powerful dissents at the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg epitomized powerful yet respectful argument; that you can disagree with someone without being disagreeable to them. Justice Ginsburgâs work helped bring about greater equality for women, secure rights for the disabled, and will continue to influence our Nation for generations to come. In addition to her quick mind, she brought flair to the bench with her stylish jabots and her warm friendships among colleagues, even those with whom she often disagreed, most notably with the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nA fighter to the end, Justice Ginsburg defeated cancer and the odds numerous times â all while continuing to serve on the Court. Her commitment to the law and her fearlessness in the face of death inspired countless âRBGâ fans, and she continues to serve as a role model to countless women lawyers.

{"state":"United States","date":"2020-09-11","reason":"Presidential Proclamation on Patriot Day, 2020\n\n In 2001, our Nation, united under God, made an unbreakable promise never to forget the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who were senselessly killed on September 11. On this sacred day â Patriot Day â we solemnly honor that commitment. As the bells toll, we call by name those who perished in the terrorist attacks in New York, New York; Arlington, Virginia; and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. In cities and towns across our great country, we stand in solidarity to remember the victims and mourn their stolen hopes and dreams.\n\nOn a day that began as ordinary as any other, terrorists carrying out a sadistic plan murdered thousands of our fellow compatriots. With shock and disbelief, we watched our first responders, encumbered by heavy equipment and hindered by debris and smoke, rush with conviction and courage into the void to rescue those in despair. With pride and sorrow, we felt the tremendous bravery of those aboard Flight 93, who summoned the courage to charge the terrorists in a counterattack that saved countless American lives. As the day closed, America steadied its resolve to hold accountable those who had attacked us and to ensure it would never happen again.\n\nThe courage, heroism, and resilience Americans displayed on 9/11, and in its aftermath, are perpetual testaments to the spirit of our country. While our Nation was anguished by this attack, the grit displayed that day â the very essence of America â was a reminder that our citizens have never failed to rise to the occasion. Heroes sprang into action in the face of great peril to help save their fellow Americans. Many laid down their lives. As we reflect on the events of that September morning, let us recommit to embrace the stalwart bravery displayed and reaffirm our dedication to defending liberty from all who wish to deny it.\n\nTo fulfill our collective promise never to forget, we impart the memory of that fateful day to our children and grandchildren. The smoke that rose from the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and the Pennsylvania field carried away the souls of innocent Americans. As we recall the images of our American Flag raised from the ashes of Ground Zero and the Pentagon, we are reminded that good triumphs over evil. We recommit ourselves to fortifying our cherished American values so that future generations will know in their souls that the United States is the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nThis Patriot Day, we commemorate the lives of those who perished on September 11, 2001, we pray for the families who carry on their legacies, and we honor the unmatched bravery of our Nationâs first responders. We also commend those who, in the days and years following the attack, answered the call to serve our country and continue to risk their lives in defense of the matchless blessings of freedom.\n\nBy a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress designated September 11 of each year as âPatriot Day.â\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2020, as Patriot Day. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day in honor of the innocent people who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of the innocent people we lost that day and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor those victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fifth.\n\nDONALD J.

{"state":"United States","date":"2020-05-15","reason":"FACT: On average, one law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty somewhere in the United States every 58 hours. Since the first known line-of-duty death in 1791, more than 20,000 U.S. law enforcement officers have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nToday, in the United States, 950,000 law enforcement officers put their lives on the line for the safety and protection of others. They serve with valor and distinction â and with great success. Federal statistics show that violent and property crime rates in the United States are at historic lows, thanks in large measure to the dedicated service of the men and women of law enforcement.\n\nThat protection comes at a price, however. Each year, there are approximately 60,000 assaults on law enforcement officers, resulting in nearly 16,000 injuries. Sadly, over the last decade, an average of 160 officers a year have been killed in the line of duty.\n\nAs of late December, 2019, 128 officers had died in the line of duty. That's an 18% decrease from same period last year. Firearms-related fatalities were the leading cause of officer deaths, with 49 officers killed in 2019. This represents a six percent decrease over the 52 officers killed in firearms-related incidents during the same period last year. Six were killed in ambush-style attacks. The leading circumstances of firearms-related fatalities were officers responding to a domestic related call, serving a high-risk warrant, and investigative activity. according to data released by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), a nonprofit aimed at honoring officers and improving safety.\n\nThe states with the highest number of officer deaths in 2019 were Texas (17), New York (11), California (9) and Alabama (7). Seventeen states and the District of Columbia did not lose an officer this year.\n\nPeace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week pay tribute to the local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers who serve and protect us with courage and dedication. These observances also remind us of the ongoing need to be vigilant against all forms of crime, especially to acts of extreme violence and terrorism.\n\nLet's Honor Those Who Made the Ultimate Sacrifice and Those Who Continue to Serve\r\nPresident Trump's Proclamation on Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2020\n\nOn Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we commend the brave men and women of our law enforcement community for continually summoning the courage to fulfill their solemn oath to protect and serve. We also pause to remember all those who have lost their lives and who have suffered permanent disabilities defending their communities and the rule of law, including the heroes we have lost this year to the coronavirus.\n\nThroughout our Nationâs history, law enforcement officials have never wavered in the face of crisis or tragedy. During uncertain times, law enforcement officers bravely face challenges and continue to protect the American people. They steadfastly ensure the safety of our communities, providing a much needed sense of security for our citizens, and our country is extremely grateful for their efforts.\n\nMy Administration remains committed to ensuring our Nationâs Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement officers have the resources and support they need to perform their duties safely and effectively. Last October, I was proud to sign an Executive Order to establish the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice â the first commission on law enforcement in half a century. This Commission identifies ways to reduce crime while simultaneously bringing law enforcement officers and the communities they serve closer together. We have also worked to expand lifesaving programs like the National Blue Alert Network. Thirty-five States have enacted Blue Alert plans, which provide early warnings to law enforcement agencies, the media, and the public by transmitting Blue Alerts to cell phones, television stations, and other devices. These alerts disseminate information on suspects who pose an imminent and credible threat to the safety of our officers, and this network demonstrates how we can work together to provide proactive programs, innovative resources, and cutting-edge technology to support and advance our law enforcement personnel.\n\nWe must continue working toward a time when all people respect and understand the important work that law enforcement officers do. Unfortunately, our law enforcement officers do not always receive the respect they deserve. These brave men and women must operate in an environment where their moral and legal authority is constantly being scrutinized, and they undertake the critical yet difficult task of addressing the actions of those affected by addiction, homelessness, and mental illness. Their ability to work well in the face of these and other challenges is extraordinary, and we have incredible appreciation for their public service and selflessness.\n\nOn behalf of our grateful Nation, we proudly recognize the more than 900,000 sworn members of law enforcement for their resolve and dedication in the face of dangerous uncertainty. The thoughts and prayers of our Nation are with them and their families, and we will always owe them our appreciation and support.\n\nBy a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (Public Law 87-726, 76 Stat. 676), and by section 1 of Public Law 105-225 (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as âPeace Officers Memorial Dayâ and the week in which it falls as âPolice Week.â\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2020, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 10 through May 16, 2020, as Police Week. In honor of our hardworking law enforcement officers, Melania and I will light the White House in blue on May 15, 2020. I call upon all Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag from their homes and businesses on that day.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\n\neighth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth.\n\nDONALD J.

{"state":"United States","date":"2019-12-07","reason":"Seventy-eight years ago today, the course of our Nationâs history was forever altered by the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor on Oahu, Hawaii. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we solemnly remember the tragic events of that morning and honor those who perished in defense of our Nation that day and in the ensuing 4 years of war.\n\nJust before 8 a.m. on December 7, 1941, airplanes launched from the Empire of Japanâs aircraft carriers dropped bombs and torpedoes from the sky, attacking our ships moored at Naval Station Pearl Harbor and other military assets around Oahu. Following this swift assault, the United States Pacific Fleet and most of the Army and Marine airfields on the island were left decimated. Most tragically, 2,335 American service members and 68 civilians were killed, marking that fateful day as one of the deadliest in our Nationâs history.\n\nDespite the shock of the attack, American service members at Pearl Harbor fought back with extraordinary courage and resilience. Sprinting through a hailstorm of lead, pilots rushed to the few remaining planes and took to the skies to fend off the incoming Japanese attackers. Soldiers on the ground fired nearly 300,000 rounds of ammunition and fearlessly rushed to the aid of their wounded brothers in arms. As a solemn testament to the heroism that abounded that day, 15 American servicemen were awarded the Medal of Honor â 10 of which were awarded posthumously. In one remarkable act of bravery, Doris âDorieâ Miller, a steward aboard the USS West Virginia, manned a machine gun and successfully shot down multiple Japanese aircraft despite not having been trained to use the weapon. For his valor, Miller was awarded the Navy Cross and was the first African-American recognized with this honor.\n\nIn the wake of this heinous attack, the United States was left stunned and wounded. Yet the dauntless resolve of the American people remained unwavering and unbreakable. In his address to the Congress the following day, broadcast to the Nation over radio, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt assured us that â[w]ith confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph.â In the days, months, and years that followed, the full might of the American people, industry, and military was brought to bear on our enemies. Across the Atlantic and Pacific, 16 million American servicemen and women fought to victory, making the world safe for freedom and democracy once again. More than 400,000 of these brave men and women never returned home, giving their last full measure of devotion for our Nation.\n\nWhile nearly eight decades have passed since the last sounds of battle rang out over Pearl Harbor, we will never forget the immeasurable sacrifices these courageous men and women made so that we may live today in peace and prosperity. We continue to be inspired by the proud legacy left by the brave patriots of the Greatest Generation who served in every capacity during World War II, from keeping factories operating on the home front to fighting on the battlefields in Europe, North Africa, and the South Pacific. Their incredible heroism, dedication to duty, and love of country continue to embolden our drive to create a better world and galvanize freedom-loving people everywhere under a common cause. On this day, we resolve forever to keep the memory of the heroes of Pearl Harbor alive as a testament to the tremendous sacrifices they made in defense of freedom and all that we hold dear.\n\nThe Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 7 of each year as âNational Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.â\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2019, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this\n\nsixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n\nUSS California sinking in Pearl Harbor\n\nOn Sunday morning December 7, 1941 the Imperial Japanese Naval service attacked Pearl Harbor\n\n- 2403 Americans were killed\n\n- 1178 Americans were injured\n\nThe day after the attack Pres. Franklin D Roosevelt declared war on the Empire of Japan\n\nI sincerely hope that during this time of remembrance you will take a few minutes to review the history of Pearl Harbor and the events of World War II. Share this information with your children and other young people. It's also a wonderful time to make a special effort and thank a World War II veteran for their gallant effort.

{"state":"United States","date":"2019-11-11","reason":"\"Duty, Honor, Country. Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be,\n\nwhat you can be, what you will be.\" - Douglas MacArthur\n\nPresidential Proclamation on Veterans Day, 2019\n\nOn November 11, Americans commemorate the service, sacrifice, and immeasurable contributions of our Nationâs veterans who have proudly worn our countryâs uniform to defend and preserve our precious liberty. As we celebrate Veterans Day, we pause to recognize the brave men and women who have fearlessly and faithfully worked to defend the United States and our freedom. Their devotion to duty and patriotism deserves the respect and admiration of our grateful Nation each and every day. We are forever thankful for the many heroes among us who have bravely fought around the world to protect us all.\n\nAs Americans, it is our sacred duty to care for and support those who have shown courage and conviction in selfless service to our country. Safeguarding the health and welfare of our Nationâs veterans has been a top priority for my Administration. Last year, I was proud to sign into law the VA MISSION Act, the most significant reform to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in more than 50 years. This historic legislation allows veterans to seek timely care from trusted providers within their communities. In 2018, I also signed the largest funding bill for the VA in history, securing $8.6 billion for veteransâ mental health services, $400 million for opioid abuse prevention, and $270 million for rural veteransâ health initiatives. Further, I recently signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Department of Education to discharge some types of Federal student loans owed by totally and permanently disabled veterans.\n\nWe also must not forget or forsake our veterans in times of distress as they transition to civilian life. That is why I signed an Executive Order in March addressing veteran suicide, a solemn crisis that requires urgent national action. Through this step, we launched the Presidentâs Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS), which is bringing together all levels of government and the private sector to improve the quality of life for our veterans, identify and assist veterans in need, and turn the tide on this tragic crisis.\n\nTime after time, throughout the history of our Republic, veterans have defended our way of life with integrity, dedication, and distinction. In respectful recognition of the contributions our service members have made to advance peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nationâs veterans. As Commander in Chief of our heroic Armed Forces, I humbly thank our veterans and their families for their willingness to answer the call of duty and for their unwavering love of country. Today, we pledge always to fight for those who have fought for us, our veterans, who represent the best of America. They deserve our prayers, our unending support, and our eternal gratitude.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2019, as Veterans Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the fortitude and sacrifice of our veterans through public ceremonies and private thoughts and prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities to support this day with commemorative expressions and programs.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-fourth.\n\nDONALD J.

Currey was awarded the Medal of Honor for actions during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 when he knocked out an enemy tank, drove back enemy troops and rescued five American Soldiers who had been pinned down under enemy fire. After the war, Currey, who was born in Loch Sheldrake and raised in Hurleyville, returned to New York and worked at the Albany VA Medical Center from 1950 until 1980. According to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society he was the last living New Yorker to have earned the Medal during World War II and one of only three living World War II Medal of Honor recipients.\n\n\"Francis S. Currey was a true American hero who made great personal sacrifices to serve his country during World War II,\" Governor Cuomo said. \"His significant contributions during the Battle of the Bugle and beyond helped to defeat fascism during the war, and he continued to serve his country after returning home to New York through his work with veterans. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend our sympathy to his friends and family and express our sincerest gratitude for his service, bravery and accomplishments.\"\n\nCurrey was serving as a Private 1st Class in the Army's 30th Infantry Division when the massive German offensive against American troops in the Ardennes Forest of Belgium kicked off in December of 1944.\n\nOn Dec. 21, 1944 Currey's unit, 3rd Platoon of Company K of the 120th Infantry Regiment, was defending a bridge over the Warche River in the Belgian town of Malmedy. A German attack overran the position that Currey and five other Soldiers were defending. Currey and the other Americans retreated to a nearby factory under heavy German fire. Currey located a bazookaâan anti-tank weaponâand then ran across the street in full view of the enemy to secure rockets for the weapon. With assistance from another soldier he knocked out the German tank with one shot.\n\nCurrey then moved to another position and killed or wounded three German Soldiers emerging from an enemy-held building with his automatic rifle. He took the bazooka and moved to a position 50 yards from the enemy-held building, stood erect, and then fired at the building, collapsing a wall.\n\nFrom this position, Currey observed five American Soldiers trapped by fire from the enemy held building and three German tanks. He moved to an abandoned vehicle, retrieved an armful of anti-tank grenades and launched them at the German tanks using an M-1 rifle. This forced the enemy soldiers to flee. Currey then climbed into an abandoned half-track and fired its .50 caliber machine gun at the German occupied position. He moved again to an abandoned .30 caliber machine gun position and opened fire on the enemy, allowing the trapped Americans to escape.\n\nHis actions forced the enemy to withdraw, securing the flank of his battalion's position and slowing the German advance for 12 hours. After night fell Currey and the other Americans withdrew.\n\nAlong with the Medal of Honor, Currey was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. Belgium awarded him the Order of Leopold, their nation's highest honor. Currey was memorialized with a special G.I. Joe military figure in 1998 and appeared on the cover sheet of a series of Medal of Honor stamps in 2013.\n\nSince 2003 Hurleyville, the town where Currey grew up, has marked Francis S.

This week, we honor and remember the heroic firefighters and first responders who made the ultimate sacrifice to save and protect our citizens, homes, and communities. We express our gratitude for their service to our country, and we encourage all Americans to do their part to prevent dangerous fires.\n\nIn 2017, more than 1.3 million fires killed 3,400 people and injured 14,000 more, while causing an estimated $23 billion in direct property loss. Sadly, the number of fire-related deaths continues to rise, even though the number of fires is falling. All Americans should take the dangers of fires seriously and conduct routine inspections of smoke alarms and plan and practice home fire escapes. Such concerted efforts are crucial to stopping fires and their devastating consequences.\n\nWhile preventing fires in our homes, we also must take measures to prevent wildfires, such as the catastrophic Woolsey, Camp, and Mendocino Complex wildfires, all of which ravaged communities last year. The Camp fire killed at least 85 people, and the Mendocino Complex wildfire was the largest fire of its kind in California history. Improving the health of Americaâs forests and rangelands is critical to reducing the frequency and severity of the kind of wildfires that have devastated communities and ecosystems across the Nation. This is why I signed legislation that improves support for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interiorâs wildfire suppression operations, as well as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, which includes robust fire risk reduction measures and important forest management provisions. These bills will empower Federal agencies to actively manage our forests and rangelands and aggressively fight wildfires. Further, I issued an Executive Order to promote active management of Americaâs forests and Federal lands to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires in better partnership with State, local, and tribal officials.\n\nThis week, I urge all Americans to take special precautions to ensure fire safety in their homes and communities to help prevent fire-related tragedies. By staying vigilant, we can all do our part to protect our loved ones, homes, and communities. We recognize those who take such actions, and we pledge to continue our support for the Nationâs firefighters, first responders, and EMS providers who answer the call to serve and risk their lives to safeguard their fellow Americans and our precious land.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, Donald J.

Matt Bevin has directed that flags at all state office buildings be lowered to half-staff on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2019, in honor of a Kentucky serviceman who was killed in action during World War II, but whose remains were only recently identified.\n\nThe Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) recently announced that Navy Machinist's Mate 1st Class Ulis C. Steely, 25, of Corbin, Kentucky, was officially accounted for on Oct. 15, 2018.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 1941, Steely was assigned to the battleship USS Oklahoma, which was moored at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, when the ship was attacked by Japanese aircraft. The USS Oklahoma sustained multiple torpedo hits, which caused it to quickly capsize. The attack on the ship resulted in the deaths of 429 crewmen, including Steely.\n\nFrom December 1941 to June 1944, Navy personnel recovered the remains of the deceased crew, which were subsequently interred in the Halawa and Nu'uanu Cemeteries.\n\nIn September 1947, tasked with recovering and identifying fallen U.S. personnel in the Pacific Theater, members of the American Graves Registration Service (AGRS) disinterred the remains of U.S. casualties from the two cemeteries and transferred them to the Central Identification Laboratory at Schofield Barracks. The laboratory staff was only able to confirm the identifications of 35 men from the USS Oklahoma at that time. The AGRS subsequently buried the unidentified remains in 46 plots at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (NMCP), known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu. In October 1949, a military board classified those who could not be identified as non-recoverable, including Steely.\n\nBetween June and November 2015, DPAA personnel exhumed the USS Oklahoma Unknowns from the Punchbowl for analysis.\n\nTo identify Steely's remains, scientists from DPAA used dental and anthropological analysis. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA,) analysis.\n\nDPAA is grateful to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of the Navy for their partnership in this mission.\n\nOf the 16 million Americans who served in World War II, more than 400,000 died during the war. Currently there are 72,674 still unaccounted for from World War II, of which approximately 30,000 are assessed as possibly-recoverable. Steely's name is recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Punchbowl, along with the others who are missing from WWII. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.\n\nSteely will be buried on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2019, at Corinth Cemetery in his hometown of Corbin.\n\nAll individuals, businesses, organizations, and government agencies are encouraged to join in this tribute of lowering the flag to honor Steely."}

Johnson, 22, of Caney, was assigned to the battleship USS Oklahoma, which was moored at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, when the ship was attacked by Japanese aircraft on Dec. 7, 1941. The USS Oklahoma sustained multiple torpedo hits, which caused it to quickly capsize. The attack on the ship resulted in the deaths of 429 crewmen, including Johnson.\n\nFrom December 1941 to June 1944, Navy personnel recovered the remains of the deceased crew, which were subsequently interred in the Halawa and Nu'uanu Cemeteries.\n\nIn September 1947, tasked with recovering and identifying fallen U.S. personnel in the Pacific Theater, members of the American Graves Registration Service (AGRS) disinterred the remains of U.S. casualties from the two cemeteries and transferred them to the Central Identification Laboratory at Schofield Barracks. The laboratory staff was only able to confirm the identifications of 35 men from the USS Oklahoma at that time. The AGRS subsequently buried the unidentified remains in 46 plots at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (NMCP), known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu. In October 1949, a military board classified those who could not be identified as non-recoverable, including Johnson.\n\nBetween June and November 2015, Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) personnel exhumed the USS Oklahoma Unknown remains from the Punchbowl for analysis. To identify Johnson's remains, scientists from DPAA used anthropological analysis, as well as circumstantial and material evidence. Additionally, scientists from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis. DPAA is grateful to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of the Navy for their partnership in this mission.\n\nOf the 16 million Americans who served in World War II, more than 400,000 died during the war.

On Memorial Day, we humbly honor these incredible patriots and firmly renew our abiding commitment to uphold the principles for which they laid down their lives.\n\nAs a free people, we have a sacred duty to remember the courageous warriors who have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that our great country would endure. It is our responsibility to strive to ensure that their noble acts of dedication to our country and the cause of freedom were not in vain and to comfort the families they have left behind, who bear the heartbreak of their loss. We must ensure that the light of our Republic, and all for which these most honorable Americans willingly died, continues to shine forth brightly into the world. As President Lincoln said in 1863 during the dedication of the Gettysburg National Military Cemetery: âIt is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.â\n\nAs we approach the 75th anniversary of D-Day, we proudly commemorate those heroic and honorable patriots who gave their all for the cause of freedom during some of historyâs darkest hours. Thousands of selfless members of our Armed Forces perished on the beaches of Normandy. They bravely gave their lives to pave the way for the Allied liberation of Europe and ultimately victory over the forces of evil. Their historic sacrifices and achievements secured the future of humanity and proved Americaâs strength in defending freedom and defeating the enemies of civilization.\n\nThose who rest in the hallowed grounds of our countryâs national cemeteries laid their lives upon the altar of freedom. Today, as we unite in eternal gratitude for the sacrifices of these extraordinary Americans, let us also offer a prayer for lasting peace.

Bill Lee and Department of Veterans Services Commissioner Courtney Rogers recognize the service and sacrifice of U.S. Army Private First Class William Delaney of Kingston, who was killed on November 22, 1944 during World War II. The Roane County native served with Company A, 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division when his battalion engaged with German defenders near Grosshau, in the HÃ¼rtgen Forest in Germany. Delaneyâs foxhole was struck by an enemy artillery shell and he could not be medically evacuated. He was 24-years-old.\n\nDelaney was one of hundreds of soldiers still missing in the HÃ¼rtgen Forest by the close of the war in 1945. The American Graves Registration Command (AGRC) attempted to recover Delaneyâs remains from 1947 to 1950 but was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1947, a local citizen discovered a set of remains in the HÃ¼rtgen Forest and turned them over to the AGRC. After unsuccessful attempts at identification, the remains were buried as X-5425 in Neuville, today known as the Ardennes American Cemetery.\n\nIn June 2017, the Department of Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) disinterred X-5425 after military records and AGRC documents suggested the remains may be that of Delaney. Experts from the DPAA and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System used DNA analysis and other evidence to identify the remains. On December 17, 2018 the remains were confirmed as Delaney.\n\nâAfter more than 74 years, William Delaney will finally return home to Tennessee,â said Lee. âThis young soldierâs bravery and sacrifice should always be remembered, and Iâm glad we can honor him and his family today.\"\n\nâFinally, Private Delaney will be laid to rest in Tennessee, under a headstone with his name, in the same cemetery where his parents are laid to rest,â Rogers said. âWe extend our deepest condolences and support to his family and look forward to welcoming this Tennessee hero home.â\n\nThe dignified transfer of remains will occur on Wednesday, May 22, 2019 at McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville at 6:57 p.m. (EDT). Media planning to attend the arrival should gather at 6:30 p.m. at the Information Booth in the lower level of the airport terminal.

{"state":"United States","date":"2019-05-15","reason":"FACT: On average, one law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty somewhere in the United States every 58 hours. Since the first known line-of-duty death in 1791, more than 20,000 U.S. law enforcement officers have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nToday, in the United States, 950,000 law enforcement officers put their lives on the line for the safety and protection of others. They serve with valor and distinction â and with great success. Federal statistics show that violent and property crime rates in the United States are at historic lows, thanks in large measure to the dedicated service of the men and women of law enforcement.\n\nThat protection comes at a price, however. Each year, there are approximately 60,000 assaults on law enforcement officers, resulting in nearly 16,000 injuries. Sadly, over the last decade, an average of 160 officers a year have been killed in the line of duty.\n\nWhile in 2017, the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty dropped sharply, marking the second-lowest toll in more than 50 years, 2018 saw a significant jump in law enforcement fatalities.\n\nAs of late December, 2018, 144 officers have died in the line of duty, with 52 shot and killed. Handguns accounted for the majority of those incidents. That was up 12% from 2017, when 129 officers died, with 46 gunned down, according to data released by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), a nonprofit aimed at honoring officers and improving safety.\n\nThe states with the highest number of officer deaths in 2018 were Texas, Florida, California and New York, each of which saw 11 fatalities, according to the NLEOMF.\n\nPeace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week pay tribute to the local, State, and Federal law enforcement officers who serve and protect us with courage and dedication. These observances also remind us of the ongoing need to be vigilant against all forms of crime, especially to acts of extreme violence and terrorism.\n\nLet's Honor Those Who Made the Ultimate Sacrifice and Those Who Continue to Serve\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump Proclaims\n\nMay 15, 2019, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and\n\nMay 12 through May 18, 2019, as Police Week\n\nOn Peace Officers Memorial Day and throughout Police Week, we express our unending gratitude to our Nationâs law enforcement officers. Those brave men and women selflessly confront danger to protect our families and defend our communities. We also honor those in blue who have been killed or disabled in the line of duty. We are especially mindful of the tremendous sacrifices of the 106 heroes who laid down their lives last year while protecting their communities.\n\nMy Administration is working on several fronts to enhance the health and safety of our Nationâs law enforcement officers. The Department of Justice (DOJ) continues to promote initiatives that provide funding for bulletproof vests, active shooter training, the National Blue Alert System, and other programs that bolster the physical and mental health of those who protect us. We are making surplus military equipment available to law enforcement agencies. We are implementing the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act, which I signed into law last year, to improve the delivery of and access to mental health and wellness services. And when tragedy does strike, DOJâs Public Safety Officersâ Benefits Program stands ready and able to assist the families of the fallen and catastrophically injured.\n\nThe best way we can support law enforcement is to reduce violence crime. My Administration has secured $50 million in funding for one of the most effective crime prevention strategies in America, the Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative. This results-based and data-proven initiative is reducing violent crime nationwide by leveraging local law enforcement and community partnerships, along with strategic enforcement efforts, to arrest the most violent criminals in the most violent locations. Through the combined efforts of all levels of law enforcement, violent crime in our country is falling.\n\nOur Nationâs law enforcement officers serve with courage, dedication, and strength. They fearlessly enforce our laws, even at the risk of personal peril, safeguarding our property, our liberty, and our lives.

Our country will greatly miss his inspiring example.\n\nOn the day he turned 18, 6 months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, George H.W. Bush volunteered for combat duty in the Second World War. The youngest aviator in United States naval history at the time, he flew 58 combat missions, including one in which, after taking enemy fire, he parachuted from his burning plane into the Pacific Ocean. After the war, he returned home and started a business. In his words, âthe big thingâ he learned from this endeavor was âthe satisfaction of creating jobs.â\n\nThe same unselfish spirit that motivated his business pursuits later inspired him to resume the public service he began as a young man. First, as a member of Congress, then as Ambassador to the United Nations, Chief of the United States Liaison Office in China, Director of Central Intelligence, Vice President, and finally President of the United States, George H.W. Bush guided our Nation through the Cold War, to its peaceful and victorious end, and into the decades of prosperity that have followed. Through sound judgment, practical wisdom, and steady leadership, President Bush made safer the second half of a tumultuous and dangerous century.\n\nEven with all he accomplished in service to our Nation, President Bush remained humble. He never believed that government â even when under his own leadership â could be the source of our Nationâs strength or its greatness. America, he rightly told us, is illuminated by âa thousand points of light,â âethnic, religious, social, business, labor union, neighborhood, regional and other organizations, all of them varied, voluntary and uniqueâ in which Americans serve Americans to build and maintain the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth. President Bush recognized that these communities of people are the true source of Americaâs strength and vitality.\n\nIt is with great sadness that we mark the passing of one of Americaâs greatest points of light, the death of President George H.W. Bush.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

{"state":"United States","date":"2018-10-07","reason":"Presidential Proclamation\n\non Fire Prevention Week, 2018\nIssued on: October 5, 2018\n\n\n\nDuring Fire Prevention Week, we renew our commitment to preparedness, fire safety awareness, and individual responsibility. We also honor our brave firefighters who have lost their lives in the line of duty and their families, as well as those firefighters who continue to put themselves in harmâs way to safeguard our lives and property. Our Nationâs firefighters are heroes, and they deserve our deepest respect and gratitude for the selfless service they provide to our communities.\n\nEach year, an average of 1.4 million fires burn in the United States, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries along with billions of dollars in direct property damage. This year, in the Western and Midwestern parts of the country, wildfires of unprecedented scale and scope have threatened local wildlife and the environment and have severely impacted local and regional economies through their devastating effect on agriculture and tourism industries. In many areas, I have declared the wildfires a major disaster and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts. My Administration remains committed to providing help to those affected.\n\nAs we mark Fire Prevention Week, all Americans must be vigilant and take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of fire and to protect their families and property. It is critical to look for places in the home where fires can start, identify potential hazards, and take the steps needed to prevent these devastating fires. It is also important to regularly check and maintain smoke alarms, as these devices can provide life-saving warnings if there is a fire in the home. If a smoke alarm rings, it is essential to respond quickly, as you may have only minutes to escape safely. Furthermore, you should at least identify two ways to exit every room, ensuring all doors and windows leading to the outside open easily and are free of clutter. The National Fire Protection Associationâs âLook. Listen. Learn.â campaign reinforces these basic but essential practices that every American must follow to help ensure fire safety.\n\nThis week, we pray for all the Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial responders who are fighting wildfires and helping our communities recover, as well as for all those who have lost their loved ones or their homes due to these disasters. We also recognize the importance of actively practicing fire safety to help prevent fire-related tragedies from occurring in the future.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 7 through October 13, 2018, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 7, 2018, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nOn October 16, 2001, President George W. Bush signed legislation asking that the American flag to be lowered to half-staff on all Federal buildings to honor fallen firefighters.\n\nThe resulting Public Law 107-51 involves this action to occur every year in conjunction with observance of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service weekend which is October 6-7, 2018.\n\nTo be clear, the actual flag lowering should be done on the last day, which is the 7th. This doesn't mean that it only applies to Federal buildings, everyone is encouraged to join in this observance. Individual state Governors will most likely make their own proclamations and so will the President of the United States of America."}
{"state":"United States","date":"2018-09-11","reason":"Presidential Proclamation on Patriot Day, 2018\n\nIssued on: September 10, 2018\n\n\nOn Patriot Day, we honor the memories of the nearly 3,000 precious lives we lost on September 11, 2001, and of every hero who has given their life since that day to protect our safety and our freedom. We come together, today, to recall this timeless truth: When America is united, no force on Earth can break us apart. Our values endure; our people thrive; our Nation prevails; and the memory of our loved ones never fades.\n\nAlthough that fateful Tuesday 17 years ago began like any other, it erupted into horror and anguish when radical Islamist terrorists carried out an unprecedented attack on our homeland. In New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, the enemies of liberty took aim on America, but their evil acts could not crush our spirit, overcome our will, or loosen our commitment to freedom. Through the dust and ashes, we emerged resilient and united â bruised but not broken.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, the world came to understand the true source of Americaâs strength: A people of an indomitable will and a society rooted in the timeless values of liberty. Our love of country was made manifest through the examples of Americans engaging in countless acts of courage, grit, and selflessness. Their actions gave us hope and helped to sustain us in the days of healing that followed. We were moved by the heroism of the passengers and crew aboard United Flight 93, who sacrificed their lives to prevent further acts of terror. We were inspired by police and first responders as they rushed headlong into burning buildings to rescue the injured and trapped, and as they courageously braved fire, smoke, and debris, descending deep into piles of rubble, ash, and twisted iron to search for survivors. We were stirred to service by the deeds of those who labored in the ensuing days and months, often in dangerous conditions, to help our Nation rebuild and recover. The noble sacrifices of these true patriots are forged into the great history of America.\n\nToday, we honor the memories of the souls we lost on September 11, 2001, and pay tribute to all of the patriots who have sacrificed their lives in defense of freedom. We pray for the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen currently serving our Nation in harmâs way. We thank the dedicated men and women who keep our homeland safe and secure. We applaud the unsung patriots in city halls, community centers, and places of worship across our country whose simple acts of kindness define the greatness of America. By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as âPatriot Day.â\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2018, as Patriot Day. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half staff on Patriot Day in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.

{"state":"United States","date":"2018-05-15","reason":"FACT: On average, one law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty somewhere in the United States every 58 hours. Since the first known line-of-duty death in 1791, more than 20,000 U.S. law enforcement officers have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n\nToday, in the United States, 900,000 law enforcement officers put their lives on the line for the safety and protection of others. They serve with valor and distinction â and with great success. Federal statistics show that violent and property crime rates in the United States are at historic lows, thanks in large measure to the dedicated service of the men and women of law enforcement.\n\nThat protection comes at a price, however. Each year, there are approximately 60,000 assaults on law enforcement officers, resulting in nearly 16,000 injuries. Sadly, over the last decade, an average of 160 officers a year have been killed in the line of duty.\n\nIn 2017, however, the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty dropped sharply, marking the second-lowest toll in more than 50 years.\n\nAs of late December, 2017, 128 officers have died in the line of duty, with 44 shot and killed. That was down 10% from 2016, when 143 officers died, with 66 gunned down, according to data released by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit aimed at honoring officers and improving safety.\n\nThe only other year with fewer deaths in the past five decades was 2013, when 116 officers were killed. \"This is one of those good-news, bad-news situations,\" said Craig Floyd, president and chief executive of the fund. \"On one hand, you had 128 officers who made the ultimate sacrifice, showing the cost of public safety, but for the first time since 2013, the number of deaths has actually declined.\"\n\n\nLet's Honor Those Who Made the Ultimate Sacrifice and Those Who Continue to Serve\nPresident Donald J. Trump Proclaims\nMay 15, 2018, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and\nMay 13 through May 19, 2018, as Police Week\n\nOn Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we acknowledge the incredible service and sacrifices law enforcement personnel make each day for their fellow Americans. The brave men and women of our Nationâs law enforcement work long hours, often in dangerous situations, to protect our lives, liberty, and property. We also take this opportunity to pay tribute to law enforcement personnel who have been killed or disabled in the line of duty. We will never forget their courage.\n\nIn addition to expressing our appreciation for our dedicated law enforcement professionals, we must equip them to carry out the tremendous responsibility of keeping our communities safe. Through the Department of Justice, my Administration will continue to provide our Nationâs law enforcement agencies with the resources they need and deserve to keep our citizens safe and our communities secure. This includes providing substantial funding for hiring additional police officers, training for active shooter situations, and improving the safety of our Nationâs schools.\n\nMy Administration will also continue to advance the National Blue Alert Network, an emergency alert and early warning system that protects Americaâs law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. The Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission worked together to establish a dedicated Emergency Alert System event code. This code facilitates rapid dissemination of critical information to law enforcement agencies and the public about violent offenders who have killed, seriously injured, or who pose an imminent and credible threat to law enforcement officers. The exceptional men and women of law enforcement work every day to protect our lives, and this code helps us protect theirs.\n\nThe safety and health of our officers must be a priority for all Americans. Every day, members of law enforcement risk their lives in service to those they have pledged to protect and defend. We must not take their devotion to duty for granted, and we must do everything in our power to ensure their physical and mental well-being. Earlier this year, I was pleased to sign into law the Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act of 2017, which helps provide police officers the resources they need to deal with job stress and trauma associated with their demanding career field.\n\nThe work of law enforcement officers is essential to preserving peace in our communities and to ensuring the safety of precious lives and personal property. My Administration proudly salutes the patriots in law enforcement who selflessly serve our Nation. We also solemnly acknowledge our debt to those who have lost their lives in the line of duty. These officers and their families have our prayers and unwavering gratitude.\n\nBy a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as âPeace Officers Memorial Dayâ and the week in which it falls as âPolice Week.â\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2018, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 13 through May 19, 2018, as Police Week. In humble appreciation of our hardworking law enforcement officers, Melania and I will light the White House in blue on May 15. I call upon all Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at halfâstaff from their homes and businesses on that day.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\n\nDONALD J.

{"state":"United States","date":"2017-10-08","reason":"President Donald J. Trump Proclaims October 8 through October 14, 2017, as Fire Prevention Week\n\nFIRE PREVENTION WEEK, 2017\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nA PROCLAMATION\n\nDuring Fire Prevention Week, we recognize the dangers posed by fires and emphasize the importance of fire prevention and preparation. We also honor our Nation's brave firefighters who have lost their lives in the line of duty and their families, and those firefighters who continue to put their lives on the line each day.\n\nEach year, an average 1.4 million fires burn in the United States. In 2015, fires caused approximately 3,360 deaths and 15,700 injuries. This year, the American West has especially suffered, as wildfires have raged from California to Oregon and Montana. These fires have already consumed more than 8 million acres and destroyed more than 650 homes and other structures. All of this destruction can be sparked by a single careless act. We must remain vigilant whenever we are around fire. By taking the appropriate precautions, we can prevent fires, save lives, and protect property and the environment. In particular, we should always mind dishes on the stovetop, carefully contain and completely extinguish campfires, take care to handle fireworks away from flammable materials, and ensure that cigarettes are handled appropriately and discarded after use.\n\nWhen a fire breaks out, every second counts. A working smoke alarm can buy the few extra moments necessary to save a life. A well-conceived and regularly practiced plan can help ensure a safe and orderly fire escape for families. All Americans should create a fire escape plan and practice it yearly with their families. We must make sure to teach our children how to escape on their own and make special plans for family members with limited mobility. The National Fire Protection Association's Every Second Counts: Plan Two Ways Out campaign can help your family prepare for home fires.\n\nAs we observe Fire Prevention Week, we pray for the Federal, State, local, and tribal responders battling the wildfires in the West and around the country and for all those who have lost their homes to fires. We recommit ourselves to preventing fire-related disasters by, among other things, staying current with the latest fire-prevention techniques and raising awareness about fire-safety practices.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 8 through October 14, 2017, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 8, 2017, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\n\nDONALD J.

{"state":"United States","date":"2017-09-11","reason":"Half-Staff Alert for Monday, September 11th\n\n2017\n\nPatriot Day\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump Proclaims September 11, 2017, as Patriot Day\n\nPATRIOT DAY, 2017\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nA PROCLAMATION\n\nOn Patriot Day, we honor the nearly 3,000 innocent lives taken from us on September 11, 2001, and all of those who so nobly aided their fellow citizens in America's time of need. We rededicate ourselves to the ideals that define our country and unite us as one, as we commemorate all the heroes who lost their lives saving others.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001, will forever be one of the most tragic days in American history. Through the unimaginable despair, however, ordinary Americans etched into our history remarkable illustrations of bravery, of sacrifice for one another, and of dedication to our shared values. The shock from the indelible images of the smoke rising from the World Trade Center and Pentagon gave way to countless inspiring videos of co-workers helping one another to safety; of heroes running into collapsing buildings to save the innocent people trapped within; and to the unforgettable story of the patriots who charged the cockpit of Flight 93 to save untold numbers of lives. These heroes moved us with their bravery. They make us proud to be Americans.\n\nThroughout history, everyday Americans and first responders have done the extraordinary through selfless acts of patriotism, compassion, and uncommon courage. Not just in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, but across our great Nation, Americans on September 11, 2001, bound themselves together for the common good, saying with one voice that we will be neither scared nor defeated. The enemy attempted to tear at the fabric of our society by destroying our buildings and murdering our innocent, but our strength has not and will not waiver. Americans today remain steadfast in our commitment to liberty, to human dignity, and to one another.\n\nIt has been 16 years since the tragedy of September 11, 2001. Children who lost their parents on that day are now parents of their own, while many teenagers currently in high school learn about September 11th only from their history books. Yet all Americans are imbued with the same commitment to cause and love of their fellow citizens as everyone who lived through that dark day. We will never forget. The events of September 11, 2001, did not defeat us. They did not rattle us. They, instead, have rallied us, as leaders of the civilized world, to defeat an evil ideology that preys on innocents and knows nothing but violence and destruction.\n\nOn this anniversary, I invite all Americans to thank our Nation's incredible service members and first responders, who are on the front lines of our fight against terrorism. We will always remember the sacrifices made in defense of our people, our country, and our freedom. The spirit of service and self sacrifice that Americans so nobly demonstrated on September 11, 2001, is evident in the incredible response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The same spirit of American patriotism we movingly witnessed on September 11th has filled our hearts as we again see the unflinching courage, compassion, and generosity of Americans for their neighbors and countrymen. The service members and first responders who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and in the years of service since would be proud of what we have all witnessed over these last three weeks and what will undoubtedly unfold in the coming months of recovery. By protecting those in need, by taking part in acts of charity, service, and compassion, and by giving back to our communities and country, we honor those who gave their lives on and after September 11, 2001.\n\nBy a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as \"Patriot Day.\"\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2017, as Patriot Day. I call upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day in honor of the individuals who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and its territories and interested organizations and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the United States to participate in community service in honor of those our Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.\n\nDONALD J.
